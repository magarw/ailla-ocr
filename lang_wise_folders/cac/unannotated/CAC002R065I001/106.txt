Derivation by Compounding
Noun and verb stems may be formed by the juxtaposition
of roots and stems of the same or different classes. These
compound stems are discussed below in groups arranged by the
inflectional class of the derived stems.
Compound Noun Stems
compound noun stems--noun stems which are composed of
more than one root--are formed in Chuj by the combination of
(1) a substantive, adjective, numeral or specifier noun root
or stem with a following substantive noun stem, (2) a posi-
tional or transitive verb root with a following substantive
noun root or stem, or (3) two or more numeral noun roots or
stems. In addition, two known stems appear to combine numeral
and positional roots to form a compound noun stem.
These combinations are discussed below in terms of a
Uni-
classification based on that of Conklin (1962:122-123).
tary lexemes are stems "no segments of which may designate
categories which are identical with, or superordinate to,
those designated by the forms in question." Unitary lexemes
either simple (unsegmentable) or complex (segmentable).
Composite lexemes are stems "one or more segments of which,
under specified conditions, may (a) designate the same cate-
gories as those designated by the forms in question (abbrevi-
