His speech, which I checked against that of other San Mateo
Ixtatán informants, is in all respects typical of the San
Mateo Ixtatán dialect. His ready identification of hundreds
of local plants during a botanical survey, his participation

munity. As such, he served as a reliable source of Chuj data
and as a dependable manipulator of materials in his language.
Final analysis of the Chuj data was carried out in Chi-
cago from September, 1965, to June, 1966, under the supervi-
sion of Professors Paul W. Friedrich and Norman A. McQuown of
the University of Chicago.
