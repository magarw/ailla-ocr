Stems derived by //V1-x-up' // occur only before the in-
flected stem. The inflected stem may be inflected for tense
and person only. If the stem is inflected for tense, it takes
intransitive verb person markers (see pages 60-61); if it is
not inflected for tense, it takes transitive verb person mark-
ers. Examples of this type of compound stem are: //wác '-V1-x-
up¹...-k'áN-(ih) // to make loud squeaking noises < //wác' //
squeaking and //k'áN // to sound, //lít '-Vl-x-up
to walk on tiptoes < //lít' // on tiptoes and //ék' // to pass
by.
-?ék'-(ih) //
Stems derived in //VC₂// occur either before or after the
inflected stem. If the stem derived in //VC₂ // occurs before
the inflected stem, that stem may be inflected only for tense
and person. If the stem is also inflected for tense, personal
inflection is with intransitive verb person markers; if the
stem is inflected only for person, this inflection is with the
transitive verb person markers. Before an inflected stem,
//VC2/// must be followed by //in//.
//VC₂/
2
If the stem derived in //VC₂/// occurs after the inflect-
ed stem, it must be followed by //ok //, whether or not another
phrase follows in the same sentence.
In this case, no restric-
tions occur on the inflection of the inflected stem. Examples
of these compound stems are: //xít'-VC₂-ih...-p'át-(ih) // to
walk in files or lines < //xít' // lined up and
< //xít¹ // lined up and //p'át // to go,
//nám-VC₂-ih...?ék'-(ih) // to move like a cloud < //nám //
mist-like and //'ék¹ // to pass by, //šék-VC₂-ih...?él-(ih) //
to leave with mussed hair < //šék // with hair mussed and //él//
