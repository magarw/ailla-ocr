(2) An affricate may not occur as C₁ in a C₁VC2 root
which has as C₂ an affricate not of the same point of artic-
ulation. That is, while the combinations c_c and č_č do oc-
cur, as do č'_č' and c'_c', the combinations *c_č, *c_č',
*c¹_č, *c'_č', *č¹_c, and *č'_c¹ do not occur.
(3) The gingival fricative /s/ does not occur in a
C₁VC₂ root which has as its other consonant a gingival or al-
veolar fricative. That is, the combinations *s_s, *s_š, and
*Š_s do not occur.

*č_c, *č_c¹, *c¹_č, *c'_č¹, *č'__c,
(4) The fricatives /s/ and /š/ do not occur as C₁ in
C₁ VC₂ roots which have as C₂ one of the affricates /c/ and
/č¹/. That is, the combinations *s_c, *š_c, and *š_č' do
not occur.
(5) The fricative /š/ does not occur as C₁ in a CVC2
root which has as C₂ the affricate /c¹/. That is, the combi-
nation *š_c' does not occur.
The last three restrictions concern roots which have as
C₁ one of the fricatives /s/ and /š/. The existence of a
very few forms makes it difficult to write more general state-
ments of restrictions. Except for the roots //šúš // wasp (a
species of Polistes), //síč // hushing call to dogs, //séč //
strike by one top on another (in the game of spinning tops),
//šéč // forked, //šáč // forked, //šóč // land snail, and
//sóc' // bat (any species), these three restrictions could be
written as the following single restriction:
