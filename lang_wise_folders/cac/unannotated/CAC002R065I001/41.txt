In the first example, weak stress marks /?iš/ as
/?iš/ as a speci-
fier for the following (stressed) noun, /?íš/ woman. In the
second example, strong stress marks both occurrences of /?íš/
as nouns. The two sentences may be glossed the woman will hit
it (first example) and she will hit her (second example).
Two utterances which illustrate the contrast between
strong stress and sentence stress are the second example above
and the following sentence, in which emphasis is placed on the
verb /mák ¹/ by raising the phonetic pitch on one syllable:
1
. ?ol. 'smak ?iš°.‚?iš.š‡•
/ # ?ol smák' ?íš ?íš #234/
Pol., smak
Three possible phonetic representations of the sentence
she will hit her illustrate the range and relative strengths
of weak and strong stresses:
. ?ol. 'smak' • Piš".,?iš š÷
'?iš'.,?iš šė.
?iš".'?iš Š‡ •
/# ?ol smák' ?iš ?íš #¹36/
23
/# ?ol smák' ?íš ?íš #²3 ↓/
,
In all three examples the syllable
201 may take either
the weakest phonetic stress (of four) or the next strongest
phonetic stress. Phonemically, all three examples are tran-
scribed /# ?ol smák ' ?íš ?íš #²3 ↓, and all are identical in
meaning.
