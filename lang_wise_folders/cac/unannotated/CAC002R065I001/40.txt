tend to be manifested as allophones which are noticeably long-
er in duration than the allophones of the same vowel in checked
syllables. The last vowel before open juncture also tends to
be manifested as a vocoid longer in duration than vocoids in
other syllables.
Stress Allophones
Three phonemes of stress are necessary and sufficient
for the adequate description of Chuj stress patterns. Two
stresses, weak (unmarked) and strong (/'/), are sufficient to
account for contrastive stresses on lexical items. While no
perfect minimal pairs have been found, lexical items of simi-
lar phonemic shape which differ in stress patterns have been
observed: /wáleh/ value, /wálé?/ sugar cane. A third stress,
marked / "/, is necessary to describe sentence stress--the
strongest of the strong stresses in an utterance. In a pho-.
netic transcription which recognizes four levels of stress,
/ "/ is represented by the strongest stress, /'/ by either of
the two strongest stresses, and the unmarked weak stress is
The con-
represented by either of the weakest two stresses.
trast between / "/ and /'/, where both are manifested as the
same phonetic stress, is maintained through a secondary fea-
ture: the highest pitch level always accompanies the sentence
stress. Since pitch levels may be affected by contour phonemes,
the contrast between strong stress and sentence stress is neu-
tralized before open juncture.
Two utterances which illustrate the contrast between
weak and strong stress are the following sentences:
m
