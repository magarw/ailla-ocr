brace or //?óč-lák '-lăk' // to embrace < //lák¹ // near and
//?óč // to enter, //két-kět-an...-p'át-(in)// or //p'át-
két-két-an-(ok) // to walk slowly and weakly < //két // walk-
ing slowly and weakly and //p'át // to go.
Stems derived in //V1-x /// occur either before or after
the inflected stem. If the stem derived in //Vl-x // precedes
the inflected stem, that stem may be inflected for tense and
person only, with intransitive verb person markers. If the
stem derived in //Vl-x // follows the inflected stem, no re-
strictions on inflection occur. Before an inflected stem,
//V1-x // is followed by //ih//; after an inflected stem, //V1-
x // is followed by // ok //. Examples of these compound stems
are: //két-Vl-x-ih...-p'át-(ih) // or //p'át-két-Vl-x-ok // to
be barely walking < //két // walking slowly and weakly and
//p'át // to go, //lít'-Vl-x-ih.. -?ék¹-(ih) // or //ék¹-lít'-
Vl-x-ok // to walk on tiptoes < //lít' // on tiptoes and //ék' //
to pass by.
Compound verb stems which incorporate noun stems into
the verb stem are composed of a transitive verb root derived
with //w-ih // and an unstressed noun stem. The noun stem may
not be inflected. The compound verb narrows the meaning of
the transitive verb stem to include only action carried out
the object specified by the noun stem. The compound stems are
inflected as intransitive verb stems. Examples are: //pay-w-
in-Năl// to dry maize with heat < //pay-w-ih // to dry something
out and //Nál // ear of maize, //áw-w-ih-?ăw-al// to plant
//*áw // to plant something and //áw-al // cornfield.
