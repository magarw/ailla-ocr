data. From August, 1964, to September, 1965, I carried out
further investigations in Huehuetenango, Guatemala, with the
aid of a native Chuj speaker from San Mateo Ixtatán. The
data collected in that period consist of extensive notes
taken from slightly more than one year of intensive patterned

All textual material was first recorded on magnetic tape
in conversational situations, transcribed in phonemic orthog-
raphy by the major informant, checked against the tape record-
ing, re-checked with the major informant, and then translated
into Spanish phrase by phrase. Roots, stems, and lexical
items were added to a slip-file dictionary that contains ap-
proximately 10,000 entries. A major source of roots not found
in the textual material was a list of all possible monosyllabic
root shapes. Each of the potential roots was tested for occur-
ence in several derivational and inflectional paradigms, and
each root identified in this manner was added to the dictionary

I consider these data to be of high reliability. The

adequacies in my preliminary phonemic orthography. His tran-
