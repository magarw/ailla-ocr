Before open juncture, /p/ is manifested phonetically as
a voiceless bilabial stop, followed by a syllable consisting
of the stop closure and a voiceless vocoid: [p.py.1.1 The vo-
coid may be a repetition of the vowel preceding the stop, a
similar but centralized vocoid, or the high central vocoid [i].

Before a consonant or close juncture, /p/ is manifested
phonetically as a tense,
a tense, voiceless, bilabial stop, without re-
lease. Unless pre-consonantal /p/ is either the initial mem-
ber of a consonant cluster which follows juncture, or the me-
dial member of a three-consonant cluster, a syllable boundary
follows the bilabial stop.
In the phonetic transcriptions of Chuj material, the
following symbols will be used: [.] syllable boundary; [¹]
strongest stress; [, weaker stress; [ ] (unmarked) weakest
stress; [] voiceless; [] non-syllabic; [-] fricativized
contoid; [>] backed; [<]^fronted; [^] raised; [v] lowered;
[] lengthened; ["] implosion of preceding contoid; ['] glot-
talization of preceding contoid; [_] blade articulation;
raised [?], simultaneous glottal closure; raised [+], pharyn-
geal or local friction; and lowered [∞], lip rounding. A
segmental phone raised slightly above other segmental phones
indicates a weak articulation. The pitch line is marked by
a solid line above, through, or below the segmental phones;
the height of the line indicates relative height of pitch.
Contoid and vocoid symbols have approximately the phonetic
values described by Trager (1958), except that the symbol [N]
is used here for the velar nasal. The symbols [C] and [V] re-
present any contoid and any vocoid, respectively.
