Roots of the shape CVCVC (other than CV₁xV₁C and
CV₁²V₁C) are common. Probably the great majority of CVC VC
forms in the total inventory of Chuj lexical items are loans
from Spanish. However, forms of CVCVC shape which are not
borrowed from Spanish also occur. Appendix C lists the 198
native Chuj forms of the shape CVCVC which have been attested.
Since the predominant pattern of Chuj roots is CVC and VC suf-
fixes are likewise common, it might be suspected that the
CVCVC forms are composed of
are composed of CVC roots and VC suffixes. If
the items listed in Appendix C were arbitrarily cut into CVC
roots and VC suffixes, the following suffixes would appear:
-ep, -ap, -up, -it, -et, -at, -ut, -ic, -ac, -uc,
-uc, -ič, -eč,
-ač, -oč, -uč, -ik, -ek, -ak, -ok, -uk, -i?, -e?, -a?, -0?,
-u?, -ip', -ep', -ap', -op', -up', -ič', -ik', -ak', -uk',
-es, -us, -iš, -eš, -aš, -oš, -ex, -ax, -ox, -ah, -uh,
-is, -es,
-im, -em,
om, -um, -in, -en, -an,
-on, -un, -uN, -aw,
-em, -am,
-ay,
-oy, -il, -el, -al, -ol, and -ul. That is, all but
forty of the possible VC combinations in Chuj would be real-
ized as suffixes. The forty hypothetical suffixes which
would not appear are -ip, -op, -ot, -ec, -oc, -it', -et',
-at', -ot', -ut' -ic',
-ec¹, -ac', -oc', -uc', -eč', -ač¹,
-oč', -uč', -ek' -ok' -as, -OS, -uš, -ix, -ux, -ih, -eh,
-oh, -iN, -eN, -aN, -ON, -iw, -ew, -ow, -uw, -iy, -ey, and
-uy.
Some of these hypothetical suffixes would occur only
once; others would occur often. Thus, while it is possible
that the Chuj CVCVC forms are bi-morphemic, without further at-
