The selection of allomorphs has been discussed on pages 62-63.
The Chuj numeral system is vigesimal, built on the dis-
tinction of zero and nineteen basic units. Extension of the
enumeration system past these basic units is based on cycles
of twenty. Unique morphemes exist for the values one through
twelve, and twenty (or score). Four hundred, twenty times
twenty, is //xúnk'al // ~ //xúnk'al wínak // . All other values
are represented by compound stems. In actual practice today,
values over 100 are usually cited with Spanish loans, and the
values less than 100 are often cited in loans-- //siNkuh
séntáwuh //, for example, often replaces //hóy-e? séntáwuh //.
five cents. The highest value presently cited with native
Chuj forms is 400, although the numerical system surely ex-
tended past that value in pre-Conquest times.
Stems for the numbers thirteen through nineteen are
compounds of the roots for the values three through nine and
the root //láxuN // ten. These stems are: //?óš-lăxuN // thir-
teen, //čáN-lăxuN // fourteen, ///hó?-lăxuN // fifteen, //wák-
lăxuN // sixteen, //húk-lăxuN // seventeen, //wáxšak-lăxuN //
eighteen, and //p'áluN-lăxuN // nineteen.
//6š-lăxuN// thir-
In the construction of numerals whose value is greater
than twenty, the value twenty is represented by //wínak // ~
//WINK' // score (or man). Even multiples of twenty are con-
structed by prefixing a numeral stem to //wínak // //wíNK' //.
Examples of these stems are: //čá?-winak // forty, //'óš-
winak // sixty, //čáN-wInak // eighty, //p'áluN-láxuN-wInak //
380.
