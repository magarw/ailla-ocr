on.
Suffixes from position +1 precede suffixes from position
+2, and so on. Only one affix from a given position may occur
in any single verb phrase. Figure 6 shows the verbal prefixes
in their relative positions; Figure 7 shows the verbal suffixes,
excluding derivational suffixes, in their relative positions.

Inflection of Noun Stems
Noun stems may be inflected for person and for number.
The inflection of substantives and adjectives, specifiers, and
numerals differs slightly. Since noun stem inflection is less
complex than that of verb stems, involving fewer inflectional
positions, the affixes will be discussed below according to
the inflectional class of the stem rather than the relative
order of the affixes.
Inflection of Substantives
and Adjectives
Substantive and adjective noun stems may be inflected
for person and for number. Personal inflection indicates the
possessor of the object or feature specified by the noun stem.
Inflection for number indicates singularity or plurality of
either the possessor or the object or feature itself.
Inflection of substantives and adjectives for person
is identical to the inflection of transitive verb stems for
personal subjects (see page 117). The inventory of person
markers is the same as that for transitive verb subject mark-
ers, and the same distributional restrictions occur with re-
spect to the initial consonant of the stem. The selection of
allomorphs of these person markers is discussed on page 65.
