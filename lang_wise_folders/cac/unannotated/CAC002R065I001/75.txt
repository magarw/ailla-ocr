Stress Alternation
70
The placement of strong stresses is not predictable by
phonological criteria, and not entirely predictable by either
morphological or syntactic criteria alone. In general, poly-
syllabic roots or sequences of root plus affixes take weak
stress on their final syllables before close juncture, and
these syllables optionally take strong stress before open
juncture. Monosyllabic roots are optionally stressed before
open juncture and generally stressed elsewhere. Multiple
factors determine the details of the placement of stress.
Strong stress falls on the head of a construction;
since the heads of most constructions are roots, the result
is an apparent connection between morphological category
(status as a root) and strong stress. However, in multiple-
root constructions such as compound nouns, weak stress on one
or more roots may be obligatory. On the other hand, in long
single-root constructions, some affixes may take obligatory
strong stress.
Monosyllabic roots of necessity take strong stress, when
they are stressed, on their only vowel. Native bisyllabic roots
take an assigned strong stress on their first syllable. But
while most bisyllabic Spanish forms with penultimate stress
are borrowed as such, some of these loans take obligatory
final weak stress and others take optional final strong
stress. The Spanish cuenta, for instance, is borrowed as
/wéntah/ ~ /wéntáh/, but finca occurs only as /píNkah/ and
never as */píNkáh/. Polysyllabic native roots such as those
