verb stem beginning in // // or ///h// is inflected both for
intensity and for person, the preson markers follow //té// :
//c-té-y-?éč'-ha? // he pinches it intensively < //?éč' // to
pinch something.
Verbal prefix position -2 is occupied by the prefixes
of personal subject--except as noted above in the discussion
of //té// and the transitive verb prefixes. The prefixes of
personal subject are //hin // ~ //w// first person singular,
//hač // //ha // //h// second person singular, //01/ // s //
~ //y // third person singular or plural, //hoN // //ko//..
//k// first person plural, and //heš // //he // //hey //
second person plural. The selection of allomorphs has been
discussed on pages 60, 61, and 65. Examples of the intransi-
tive verb personal subject markers are: //c-hin-p'át-(ih) //
I go, //?ol-hač-p'át-ok // you will go, //?iš-Ø-p'át-(ih) // he
went, //?iš-Ø-p'át hep'-wín // they went, //c-hoN-p'át-(ih) //
we go, //c-heš-p'át-(ih) // y'all_go. Examples of the transi-
tive verb personal subject markers before verb stems beginning
in //? // or //h// are: //c-w-?úk'-ex // I drink it, //c-h-?úk '
ex // you drink it, ///c-y-?úk'-ex // he drinks it, //c-k-?úk ¹-
ex// we drink it, //c-hey-?úk '-ex // y'all drink it. Examples
of the transitive verb personal subject markers before other
stems are: //c-hin-mák'-ha? // I hit it, ///c-ha-mák'-ha? // you
hit it, //c-s-mák¹-ha? // he hits it, //c-ko-mák¹-ha? // we hit
it, //c-he-mák'-ha? // y'all hit it. Note in the examples for
verbal prefix position -1 that //té// follows two sets of per-
-l
depindep
son markers, but precedes one set of person markers.
