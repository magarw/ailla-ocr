Verbal prefix position -3 is attested by only one form:
//c-heš-ek'-w-?ïl-kan-(ih) // I come around to see y'all <
//íl-kan-(ih) // to see
to see someone. In this form, the appearance
of //ek' // between the subject and object markers //w// and
//heš // indicates that the intransitive verbs of directional

mák '-ha? // we hit it,
we hit it, //c-heš-w-?íl-ha? // I see y'all, //c-hoN-
