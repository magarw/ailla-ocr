//tak // derives noun stems from noun stems, and is
obligatory after //im//, //eč //, and stems formed with //il//
from positional roots. The suffix //tak// indicates plural-
ity, usually implying an uncountable mass or multitude of
features. Examples of the derivation are: //kélem-tak //
young men < noun root
< noun root //kélem // young man, //kús-el-tak //
sad persons ‹ noun stem //kús-el // sadness < intransitive
verb root ///kús // to be sad, //láN-č-im-tak// ripped and
patched clothes < transitive verb root //lán // to carry a
bundle of disorderly fibers, //c'íp'-il-tak // lined or
striped object ‹ positional root ///c'íp' // marked with lines.
//ok // derives noun stems from numeral stems already
derived with ///e//. The stems indicate that the numerical
values are approximate. Examples of the derivation are:
//xún-ok // about one < //xún // one, //?óš-e?-ok // about three
< //?óš-e? // three.
Formation of Positional
Stems
//CVC //, complete reduplication of the root, derives
positional stems from positional roots. Examples of the deri-
vation are: //wéc-CVC-an-(ih) // to shimmer < //wéc // shiny in-
side, //két-CVC-an-ok // walking slowly and weakly < //két //
walking slowly and weakly. Note that these stems are further
derived in ///an// to form intransitive verb or adverbial
stems. Note also that this reduplication is distinct from the
inflectional reduplication for number which also occurs with
positional stems.
