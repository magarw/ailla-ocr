which is released after the fricative: [.t's'?].

Allophones of /č¹/
/ # c'ák #³ /

/# péc'án #23/
Before open juncture, /č¹/ is manifested phonetically as
a voiceless syllable consisting of a fortis, voiceless, blade-
articulated, alveolar stop, followed by a voiceless homorganic
fricative and a voiceless high central vocoid, with glottal
constriction on all three segments. The stop may be antici-
pated in the preceding syllable.

/ # ?íč¹ #³↓/
•‚ti?.'?it.±'š'÷• / # tí?íč' #²36/
Before a consonant or close juncture, /č¹/ is manifest-
ed phonetically as a fortis, voiceless, blade-articulated,
alveolar stop, followed by a voiceless homorganic fricative,
with glottal constriction on both segments. A syllable bound-
ary follows the fricative. Before a high front, non-syllabic,
voiced vocoid, the fricative segment is missing, and the pho-
nemic contrast with /t'/ is maintained through the blade-ar-
ticulation and slightly backer position of /č¹/.
