(3′) The fricatives /s/ and /š/ do not occur as C₁ in
a C₁ VC₂ root which has as C₂ a gingival or alveolar fricative
or affricate.
The restrictions on CVC root shapes thus
on CVC root shapes thus concern mainly
the gingival-alveolar region and fricative and affricate ar-
ticulation. Other gaps in the consonant co-occurrence chart
are due to the infrequent occurrence of the phoneme /t'/ and
the rare occurrences of /h/ and /y/ as root-initial consonants.
Note that /h/ and /y/ do occur in hVC and yVC sequences, but
as person markers and not as parts of the root.
CV(C)CVC Roots
Roots of the CV(C)CVC shapes include a number of forms
which may in fact be bi-morphemic. However, it is difficult
to justify morpheme cuts, as the individual parts seldom if
ever recur. All known native bisyllabic roots are nouns.
The set of CVCCVC forms is listed in Appendix A, where a pos-
sible etymological analysis is noted if part of the bisyllabic
root is attested as a root in other environments. The CVC VC
roots have been divided into three sets: CV₁x C
a set which includes all other CVCVC roots.

The CV₁xV₁C roots are apparently developments of an
earlier Proto-Mayan *CVxC shape (Terrence S. Kaufman, person-
al communication); the Chuj root //náxat // distant, for exam-
ple, is cognate with the Tzeltal form /naht/. One Chuj
