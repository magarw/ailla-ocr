Stative Root
Stative stems are common, but only one root, //?áy //
to be, has been observed to take only stative inflection.
Formation of Stems
Roots are
commonly affixed with a number of derivation-
al affixes. The combination of root and derivational affix
forms a stem with a meaning related to that of the root, which
may or may not be of the
of the same inflectional class as the root.
The derivational affixes are discussed below in groups accord-
ing to the inflectional class of the derived stem.
Other stems are formed by compounding roots of the
class or of different classes. These compound stems are dis-
cussed below, and are grouped according to the inflectional
class of the derived stem.
Derivation by Affixation
Most roots may be inflected without derivation, but it
is common for roots to be affixed with one or more derivation-
al morphemes. With the exception of root compounding, Chuj
derivation is limited to suffixation. Suffixes derive verb,
noun, stative, adverbial, and numeral classifier stems.
