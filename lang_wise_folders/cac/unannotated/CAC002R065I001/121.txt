Inflection of Stems
Inflection of Verb Stems
Verb stems may be inflected by affixation for personal
subject, personal object, tense-aspect, directional motion,
intensity of action, repetition of action, negation, and state
of knowledge of the speaker. Most of these inflections are
optional; some are obligatory (see Verb Phrases, page 145).
Both prefixed and suffixed inflectional affixes occur, and in
cases inflection for a given feature may be carried out
by either a prefix or a suffix or both.
Verbal Prefixes
Obligatory inflections tend to occur in positions near
the verb stem. For this reason, the verbal prefixes will be
presented in the order opposite to that in which they occur in
speech. Potentially filled positions are numbered from -1
(nearest to the stem) to -9 (most distant from the stem).
Verbal prefix position -l is filled by the optional pre-
fix //té//, the presence of which indicates that the verbal
action is stronger or more effective than usual. Examples
of verb stems inflected with ///té // are: //c-hoN-té-k'ún-p'-
(ih) // we get very tired < //k'ún-p'-(ih)// to tire, //c-hoN-
té-ém Nóx-an // we lean over more than usual (in doing a cer-
tain kind of work) < //ém Nóx-an // to lean over, //Ø-té-mák '-
n-aš-š-(ih) // he was beaten hard again < //mák ¹-n-aš-š-(ih) //
to be beaten again, //c-ko-té-p'ó?-ex // we work at it so much
< //p¹ó?-ex// to fix something. Note that if a transitive
