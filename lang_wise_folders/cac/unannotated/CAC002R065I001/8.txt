and includes most of the municipio of Nentón. The existence
of a small number of Chuj speakers in an adjacent area within
Mexico has been reported by Tejeda (1958). There are two ma-
jor dialects of Chuj One of these, the dialect described in
this study, is spoken in the municipio of San Mateo Ixtatán
and in the northern two-thirds of the municipio of Nentón.
The second dialect, which has been described briefly by
Williams and Williams (1966), is spoken in the municipio of
San Sebastián Coatán and in the southeastern corner of the mu-
nicipio of Nentón. The boundaries of the San Mateo dialect
were determined in a dialect survey carried out by Nicholas
A. Hopkins and Francisco Santizo Andrés in the Summer of 1965.
Additional information concerning the location of Chuj speak-
ers was elicited from informants in critical areas. In addition
to the primary linguistic data, a number of secondary sources
were consulted. Principal among these were Recinos (1954),
Valdés Oliva (1965), and the language maps prepared by the
Seminario de Integración Social (1964) and the Instituto In-
digenista Nacional (1962). The distribution of Chuj dialects
shown in Figure 1 is a synthesis of these sources.

The exact number of Chuj speakers is unknown, since the
Mexican and Guatemalan censuses record only the fact that an

population in Mexico are available, but this population prob-
