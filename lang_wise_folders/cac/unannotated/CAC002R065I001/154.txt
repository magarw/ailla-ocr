possessive noun phrase.
However, the latter noun phrase may
not have as its explicit possessor another possessive noun
phrase. That is, while it is grammatical to form the posses-
sive noun phrase //s-xólom s-pének wẤN // his knee (where
//wíN // male animate being makes explicit the possessor in the
possessive noun phrase //s-pének wẤN // his leg, and this
phrase in turn makes explicit the possessor of //xólom // head),
the phrase *//s-xólom
//s-xólom s-pének s-mám wíN // his father's knee is
not grammatical. Chains of more than two noun phrases in suc-
cessive possessive relationships may be formed only by en-
closing some of the possessive noun phrases within specifier
noun phrases. For example, use of the phrase //wIN s-mám
wẤN
WIN // his father (a specifier noun phrase) in place of the
possessive noun phrase //s-mám wẤN // his father makes possible
the construction of the phrase //s-xólom s-pének WIN s-mám
wẤN // his father's knee. The specifier noun phrase may like-
wise enclose two, but not three, successive possessive noun
phrases: //s-xólom s-pének wIN y-úk'tak s-mám wẤN // his fa-
ther's brother's knee, literally, the head of the leg of the
male animate being (who is) the brother of the father of the
male animate being. Other examples of possessive noun phrases
are: //s-c'ú?m-al k'é”n// the knife's scabbard (literally,
the leather parts of the metal object), //s-c'ú?m-al hin-
k'é?n // my knife's scabbard, //s-xólom hin-pének // my knee
(literally, the head of my leg), //s-yémpuh-al k-²ák'-an-
?óč k-aw-al// the time we work in our cornfield (where the
phrase which makes explicit the possessor of //s-yémpuh-al //
