Compound Verb Stems
Several types of Chuj verb stems contain more than one
root. One type, suffixation of a limited set of intransitive
verbs of directional motion, will be discussed as inflection
rather than as derivation. This type differs from those list-
ed here in that the directional verb inflection involves a
small set of morphemes, and the semantic difference between
the stem with and without the directional verb is usually mini-
mal. Four other types of compound verb stems
One is
causative; another incorporates Spanish infinitives into the
Chuj verb system. A third type of compound verb stem, based
the intransitive verbs of directional motion, incorporates ad-
verbial stems into the verb stem. The fourth type of compound
verb stem, based on transitive verb roots, incorporates noun
stems into the verb stem.
The causative verb stems based on //?ák' // to do some-
thing consist of the verb root //ák' //, which optionally is
