Pitch and Contour Allophones
No phonemes of pitch or of contour are postulated on a
lexical level, as no two lexical items differ in pitch or
contour alone. However, the distribution of pitches and
pitch contours over a string of morphemes cannot be predicted
on phonological grounds. Phonemic pitches and contours have
thus been established.
The three phonemic contours occur only in connection with
open juncture and are manifested phonetically as rising, level,
and falling pitch line over the pre-junctural syllable.
Rising
contour is marked //, level contour is marked //, and falling
contour is marked //. The following transcriptions of the
phrases /# lum čóNáp' # / the town and /# lum píNkah # / the
plantation illustrate the phonetic manifestations of the three
contours.

Except for the last two syllables before open juncture and
syllables which are marked with sentence stress, pitch levels
can be predicted from stress phonemes--the low pitch always
occurs with weak stress and the mid pitch occurs with strong
