ed, high back vocoid, or as a combination of these segments.
After two consonants or a sequence of juncture plus consonant,
/w/ is manifested phonetically as a non-syllabic, voiced,
rounded, high back vocoid. Before open juncture, /w/ is man-
ifested phonetically as a voiced labiodental fricative, which
may be rounded and preceded by anticipatory rounding and high
back offglide of the preceding vowel; the fricative may devoice.

dental, slit fricative. Before a vowel (but not after CC, +C,
or #C), syllable boundary precedes the phonetic manifestation
of /w/. Elsewhere, except after CC, +C, or #C, syllable
