*CV?C and *CVCV?C forms, from which these Chuj roots proba-
bly developed. Note that there are also //CV?VC // roots
which are represented phonemically only as /CV?VC/ (see Ap-
pendix B). The alternation in root shape between allomorphs
of the same morpheme is illustrated in the following forms:
/# slú?um #²3 ↓/ < //s-lú?m // his land (subject not
explicit); //s-// third person possessive prefix, //lú?m //
68
/# slúm wiN #23 ↓/ <//s-lú?m wíN // his land (subject
explicit); //s-// third person possessive prefix, //lú?m //
land, //wẤN // male being
/# nok' sína?an #13\/ < //nok' sína?n// the scorpion;
//nok¹ // animal, //sína?n // scorpion
/# nok' sínan čí? #13↓/ < //nok' sína?n čí? // that
scorpion; //nok' // animal, //sína?n// scorpion, //čí? // there
Segmental Phoneme
Alternation
Some sequences of morphophonemes have special phonemic
representations which result in alternation of segmental pho-
nemes in allomorphs of the same morpheme. These sequences are
enumerated below. All other morphophonemes and combinations
of morphophonemes are represented phonemically by a symbol
identical to that which occurs in the morphophonemic transcrip-
tion. Where //-// is marked, morpheme boundary is a necessary
condition for the special phonemic representation to occur.
