Before a vowel, /k/ is manifested phonetically as
voiceless velar stop with either simultaneous glottal closure
or slight implosion. After a vowel, the stop is fortis; af-
ter a consonant, the stop is lenis. The glottal constriction
may become complete glottal closure, releasing after the velar
stop is released, and this glottal constriction or closure may
be anticipated in the preceding syllable.

Allophones of /b/
The phoneme /b/, which occurs only in loans from Span-
ish, has not been attested before open juncture. The usual
source of /b/ is the Spanish bilabial stop, which occurs only
rarely in word-final position.
In all other positions, /b/ is manifested phonetically
as a lenis, voiced, bilabial stop. A syllable boundary pre-
cedes the stop. After open juncture, the bilabial stop may
be pre-nasalized.
