tions, and in compound numeral stems: //čá?-wá?-aN // two
animate beings, //čá?-tak-wá?-aN // two animate beings each,
//čá?-winak // two score. Elsewhere, two is represented by
//čá?p¹ // .

the second as the
value twenty, or score, in the construction of stems which
have a numerical value greater than twenty. That is, twenty
as an integer is //xúnak //; forty, or two score,
or two score, is ///čá?-

The Chuj morphemes four, five, six, seven, eight, elev-
en, twenty, and score have allomorphs which occur only before
the suffixes //-éx// //-íš // days from now, //-x // ~ //-éx //
//-š // ~ //-ĩš // days ago, and //-iN // period of days. Be-
fore these suffixes, the numerals are represented by the allo-
morphs //čón // four, //hóp' // five, //wák' // six, //húkup' //
seven, //wáxšak¹ // eight, //húšluč' // eleven, //xúnk' // twen-
ty, and //wink' // score. Otherwise these numeral roots are
represented by //čáN // four, //hó? //
six, //húk // seven, //wáxšak // eight,
//xúnak // twenty, and //winak // score.
The period of days suffix //-iN // occurs only after
numeral stems ending in //xúnk' // or //wiNk' //; that is, after
stems representing numbers higher than nineteen: //xúnk'-iN //
period of twenty days, //xún s-čá?-wiNk'-iN // period of twen-
ty-one days, but //?óš-e? k'úh-al// period of three days.
