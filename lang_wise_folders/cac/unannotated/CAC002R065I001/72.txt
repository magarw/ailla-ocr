Phonemic Representations
of Morphophonemes
Morphophonemic transcriptions as presented here utilize
essentially the same set of symbols as phonemic transcriptions.
However, the phonemic representation of a given morphophoneme
is not necessarily the phoneme whose symbol is identical.
Certain sequences of two or more morphophonemes have special
phonemic representations. That is, the phonemic representa-
tions of a morph may differ from one phonological environment
to another. In order to predict the phonemic representations
of a given morph, the following special phonemic representations
of morphophonemic sequences must be taken into account.
Root Shape Alternation
Roots written //CVC // in morphophonemic transcription
are represented phonemically by forms of the shape /CVVC/
before open juncture, and by forms of the shape /CVC/ else-
where. Roots written //CVCV°C // in morphophonemic transcrip-
tion are represented phonemically by forms of the shape
/cvcv*vc/ before open juncture, and by forms of the shape
/cvcvc/ elsewhere. This alternation of root shape in a dif-
ferent phonological environment may be the result of a
Proto-Mayan pre-junctural re-articulation of the vowel in
