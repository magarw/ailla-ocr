phrase every fifteen days is written ///y-hó?-lăxuN-il-ták
k'úh-al //, since the root and affix appear in the lexicon
as //láxuN // and //tak//, but the phonemic representation of
the construction is /yólaxuNil ták k'úhal/.

Root Types and Sub-Classes
In the description of Chuj morphology, it is convenient
to postulate the existence of six root classes, although it
is difficult to place some roots in any one class as opposed
to another. Derivation and inflection unambiguously identify
most roots as members of a certain form class and no other.
If a root is productive, observed to co-occur with a number
of derivational or inflectional affixes, its root class is
not difficult to characterize. However, when a root is at-
tested in only a few derived or inflected forms its class
membership is sometimes uncertain. Likewise, there are roots
which co-occur with two or more sets of affixes, each of which
characterizes a different root class. In these cases the as-
sumption has been made that there are two or more homorganic
roots which belong to separate root classes.
Verb Roots

Verb roots are of the shape //CVC //. Two sub-classes
of verb roots are distinguished by derivational and inflec-
tional criteria: transitive and intransitive. Verb roots
are distinguished as a class by inflection for tense and as-
