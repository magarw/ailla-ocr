be compounds related to /ší?il/ hair (which may be from an
underlying //ší?l// or bi-morphemic, from //ší? // too thin for
its length and //-il// derivational suffix) and //šóč // land
snail. Thus, many (if not all) of the //cvcvºc // forms may
have been bi-morphemic in origin. The non-recurrence of
most of the hypothetical roots, the disparity of meanings
between the hypothetical roots and noun and positional roots
which have the same
same phonemic shapes, and the absence in Chuj
of any //-V°C // suffixes other than the hypothetical suffixes
on these forms, however, make it advisable not to analyze the
//CVCV?C // forms as currently bi-morphemic. An analysis of
these forms as prefix plus //CVC // root also fails,
this case only /ší?il/ (which may in turn be bi-morphemic)
recurs as a root, and none of the
of the hypothetical prefixes re-
cur except //čá? // two, //k'áh// old, and //k'úh // sun (noun
roots which might be the first members of compounds in these
forms).

Affix Shapes
Chuj affixes are of the shapes C, VC, CV, and hVC. Suf-
fixes are C, VC, or hVC;
or hvC; prefixes are C, CV, or hvc.
hVC. The in-
ventory of affixes and their distributions with respect to
roots and stems are discussed in connection with the deriva-
tion and inflection of stems. Examples of the affix shapes
are found in the following examples:
