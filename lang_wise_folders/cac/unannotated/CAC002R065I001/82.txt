Particle Roots
Particle roots are distinct from other form classes in
that they are not derived to form verb, noun, or positional
stems, nor may they be inflected. Native particle roots are
of the shape //CVC //, but many particles are Spanish in origin
and have other shapes.

Onomatopoetic Roots
A small class of infrequently derived roots appear to
result from onomatopoeia. These roots have been grouped here
with exclamations and calls to animals, in a class of roots
which borders on paralanguage. Two main subdivisions of this
class, each with two further subdivisions, are distinguished
by derivational criteria. These sets are: (1) onomatopoetic
roots, including (a) imitations of sounds from inanimate
sources and (b) imitations of animal noises, and (2) calls
and exclamations, including (a) calls to animals and (b) ex-
clamations. The known inventory of these roots is small, and
all known examples are listed below.
