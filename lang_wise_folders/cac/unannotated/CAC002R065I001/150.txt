CHAPTER III
PHRASE AND SENTENCE STRUCTURE
S
The formation and inflection of stems has been dis-
cussed in the previous chapter. In the present chapter, the
composition of verb, stative, particle, and noun phrases will
be outlined, and the construction of sentences from the se
phrases will be discussed.
Phrase Structure
Four types of phrases are recognized here: verb
phrases, stative phrases, particle phrases, and noun phrases.
The structures of verb, stative, and particle phrases are
relatively simple; the structure of noun phrases is relative-
ly complex.
Verb Phrases
The verb phrase consists of an inflected verb stem.
Minimal inflection of a stem is inflection for personal sub-
ject; that is, inflection for personal subject is obligatory
and all other inflections are optional. However, if a verb
stem is inflected for any feature other than personal sub-
ject, it must also be inflected for tense-aspect. Examples
of verb phrases may be found in the discussion of verbal af-
fixes, pages 116-130.
