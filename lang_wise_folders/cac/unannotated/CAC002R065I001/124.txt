//ěk' // passing by, and //p'at // going. The allomorphs which
occur here are the same as those which appear in verbal suf-
fix position +5. Examples are: //c-hul-w-ak' he-pášyal //
I come to give y'all a visit; //c-p'&t-hin-k'ul-ex // I am
going away to do it, //ol-p¹at-ko-ló?-?ěm-(ih) // we will go
down there to eat it, //xun hin-wyáxah šľt'-w-?ák' t'ay
wáríyah // a trip I made to Barillas.
Verbal prefix position -6 contains //ham // interrogative
and //hap¹ // reportative. The first, //ham //, states a request
for information. The second, //hap' //, specifies that the in-
formation contained in the rest of the verb phrase is hearsay,
not witnessed by the speaker. Examples of these inflections
are: //c-ham-hač-p'át-(ih) // are you going?, //Ø-ham-hač-p'át-
(ih) // did you go?, //Ø-ham-hač-s-mák '-ha? // did he hit you?,
//iš-hap¹-6-s-mák ¹-ha? // they say he hit it, //wan-hap'-s-
p'át-(ih) // they say he went, //Ø-hap¹-s-y-?ák¹-an čáN-al //
they say they have dances, //c-hap¹-s-č'óš s-p'áh // they say
they show themselves.
Verbal prefix position -7 contains markers of tense and
aspect. These are //ol// future inchoative, //wal // progres-
sive, and //wan-(ok-lax) // progressive; note that verbal pre-
fix position -8 contains other tense-aspect markers.
er //ol// specifies futurity of action; //wal // and //wan-(ok-
lax) // indicate that the action is or was in progress at some
non-future time specified elsewhere in the discourse.
Inflection of intransitive verb stems with //ol// usu-
ally requires the suffix //ok // in verbal suffix position +1
