//x// derives intransitive verb stems from stems de-
rived with ///V1/// from positional roots. Further derivation
of these stems with ///ok /// to form adverbial stems is common.
One case of the derivation of an intransitive verb stem from
a noun root by the suffixation of //x// has been observed.
Examples of these derivations are: //két-Vl-x-(ih) // to be
barely standing ‹ positional root //két // barely standing,
//lít'-Vl-x-ok // on tiptoes < positional root ///lít' // on
tiptoes, //?ál-x-(ih) // to grow up or to wax (in reference
to the phases of the moon) < noun root //ál // heavy.
//VC₂ //, reduplication of the vowel and final consonant
Ex-
of the root, derives intransitive verb stems from positional
roots and onomatopoetic roots. Further derivation in ///ok //
to form adverbial stems is common. One onomatopoetic root
derived in //VC₂/// has been observed to be further derived in
//an// to form a positional stem: //hús-VC₂-an // making a
noise like a skyrocket < //hús // noise of a skyrocket.
amples of the derivation of intransitive verb stems with
// VC₂ // are: //mól-VC₂-(ih) // to be well-gathered (all present)
< positional root //mol// gathered, //kác¹-VC₂-(ih) // to be
sway-backed < positional root //kác' // sway-backed, //kúč¹.
VC₂-(ih) // to drink many swallows of a liquid without stop-
ping onomatopoetic root ///kúč' // gulping noise.
//k// derives a single intransitive verb stem from the
positional root //ták // dry: //ták-k-(ih) // to dry out.
