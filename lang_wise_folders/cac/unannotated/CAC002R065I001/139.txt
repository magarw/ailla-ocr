Inflection of Specifiers
Specifier nouns are inflected for plurality only; they
may not be inflected for personal possession. Inflection for
plurality is by prefixation of //hep' //. Note that where the
specifier is the first member of a noun phrase the pluraliza-
tion of the specifier in effect pluralizes the noun phrase.
Examples are: //hep'-wiN // they (male animate beings), //hep'-
nók' // they (animals), //hep'-nok' hin-čéx // my animals,
//hep '-?iš y-íscil// their wives or his wives.
Noun stems derived from numeral noun roots may be in-
flected for person, but this inflection differs greatly from
that of other noun stems. The inflection must be for third
person singular, and the meaning of the stem concerns not
personal possession but cyclical occurrence. Thus, stems
derived from numeral roots with //il// are inflected with //s//
//////, third person, to form ordinal numbers. Stems derived
from numeral roots and stems with //(i)š // ~ //(e)x // and
//in// are further suffixed in //il// //al// and inflected
for third person to form items which denominate cycles of
days. Other stems, derived from numeral roots with //tak //
and //il//, are also inflected with the third person prefix
to form the names of cycles of days. Examples of these in-
flections are: //s-čá?p'-il// second, //y-hó?-il// fifth,
//s-xún s-čá?-winâk-il// twenty-first, //s-čá?p¹-x-ih-al //
every two days, //y-hóp '-š-ih-al // every five days, //s-xún
s-čá?-wINk '-êx-ih-al // every twenty-one days, //s-čá?p¹-tak-il
