minimal number of legs required to form bowlegs is plural.
The positional roots found in these compounds are thus dis-
tributive positionals.
The positional stems formed with ///an //, and the com-
pound forms with reduplication of these stems, are singular.
That is, they refer to singular objects and singular features:
//čóy-an // loose (object), //t'éx-an // sitting on floor (a
single object), //pác-an pác-an // wooly (object),
(object), //t'íN-an
t'íN-an // narrow-waisted (object).
Plurality of objects described is expressed by redupli-
cation of the positional root: //pák-an pák-an hú?m // the
single piece of paper is folded once, //pák-păk húm // the
several papers are each folded once; //póc¹-an póc¹-an y-?áx-
(ih) // the single object is dented once, //póc¹-poc' y-?áx-
(ih) // the several objects are each dented once; //típ'-an
típ'-an y-?áx-(ih) hú?m // the single piece of paper is a
multi-ply cylinder, //típ'-tïp' y-?áx-(ih) hú?m // the several
pieces of paper each form a multi-ply cylinder; //píl-an píl-
an y-²áx-(ih) // the single object is small and spherical,
//pil-pil y-?áx-(ih) // the several objects are each small and
spherical.

Plurality of features is expressed by suffixing the po-
sitional root with //kiš-tak //. If the root is a distributive
positional, plurality of objects is also implied. If the root
is a non-distributive positional, the objects may either be
plural objects each of which carries a single feature,
single object which carries multiple features: //pák-kiš-tak
or a
