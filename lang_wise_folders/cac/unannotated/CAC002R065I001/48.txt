Since suffixation of roots with /il/, /ex/, /an/, /ox/,
and /um/ is common, all vowel clusters are theoretically pos-
sible. Nevertheless, few vowel clusters have been observed.
All vowel sequences which occur in Spanish are likewise po-
tential Chuj sequences, but the Chuj tendency is to borrow
Spanish vowel clusters as sequences of semivowel and vowel,
or to reduce the sequence to a single vowel. For example,
several of the lexical items cited above have alternant forms
in which the vowel cluster has been reduced: /syentuh/
/siéntoh/, /tyémpuh/ ~ /tiémpoh/, /ayés/ /diés/, /sémreh/
/siempreh/, /sáranpyón/ /sáran pión/, and /rwétah/ /ríétah/.
Consonant Clusters
Consonant clusters of C₁C₂ are common in intervocalic
position. With few exceptions, the combinations of consonants
which may occur in these clusters are limited only by the shapes
of morphemes. The exceptions involve morphophonemic changes in
which C₁ is replaced by another phoneme, or in which the whole
The regular
C₁C2 sequence is replaced by a single phoneme.
morphophonemic changes are /čč/> /tč/, /c'č/> /t¹č/, /?C/> /C/,
/hc/>/c/, and /p¹h/>/w/. A chart of the observed intervocalic
consonant clusters is found in Figure 3. Rather than showing
wide restrictions on permissible sequences of consonants, the
chart appears to reflect only the greater productivity of suf-
fixes beginning in /t č k ? š x 1/ as opposed to suffixes be-
