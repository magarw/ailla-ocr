INTRODUCTION
Chuj is a Mayan language spoken in the northwestern
part of the Department of Huehuetenango, Guatemala. The name
of the language apparently derives from a regional Spanish
term for sweatbath, a characteristic feature of Chuj house
sites. The Chuj speakers themselves refer to the language
simply as "our language."
In their classifications of the Mayan languages,
Kroeber (1939), Halpern (1942), McQuown (1956), and Swadesh
(1961) have suggested slightly different genealogical classi-
fications of Chuj. Kroeber grouped Chuj with Tzeltal, Tzo-
tzil, and Tojolabal in a single branch of the family. Halpern
and McQuown set off Chuj as a separate branch by itself, and
McQuown suggested that Chuj might less cautiously be grouped
with Jacaltec, Kanjobal, and Solomec. Swadesh grouped Chuj
with Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Tojolabal, Chortí, Chontal, and Chol.
The details of Mayan classifications are not yet clear, but
it is apparent that the Mayan languages which most resemble
Chuj are its neighbors: Tojolabal, Tzeltal, and Tzotzil to
the northwest, Jacaltec to the southwest, and Kanjobal to the
south and east.
