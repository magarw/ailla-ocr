Before a vowel, /š/ is manifested phonetically as a
voiceless, blade-articulated, alveolar, slit fricative, with
the vocal quality of a high central vocoid. The point of ar-
ticulation of the fricative is slightly backed before /o u/
and slightly fronted before /i e/. Syllable boundary pre-
cedes the fricative.

Allophones of /x/
Before open juncture, /x/ is manifested phonetically as
a voiceless, velar or post-velar, slit fricative, with the vo-
cal quality of a high central vocoid. The fricative may be
followed by a voiceless syllable consisting of a re-articu-
lation of the velar fricative and a high central (voiceless)
vocoid. The point of articulation of the fricative, which
varies from velar to post-velar, is apparently unrelated to
the vocalic environment.
