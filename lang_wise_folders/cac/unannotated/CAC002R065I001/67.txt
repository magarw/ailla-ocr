for directional motion may be considered to be allomorphs
of the same morphemes that are represented by stressed morphs
as independent intransitive verbs of directional motion. The
allomorphs which occur as inflection are //kan // remain,
//kut // draw near, //ek' // pass by, //em// go down, //el//
//uč // enter, //p'at // go, //k¹e? // rise, //k'¹oč //
arrive, and //hul// come. The allomorphs which occur as in-
transitive verb roots with essentially the same meanings are
//kán //, //kót //, //?ék' //, //ém //, //?él //, //?óč //,
//p'át //, //x'é? //, //x¹óč //, and //húl //.

The morphophonemics of numeral constructions in Chuj are
rather complex. Both numeral roots and the suffixes normally
associated with numeral constructions often have several vari-
ant forms, the morphological environment determining which
form occurs.
The numeral root five is represented by //hóy // before
the stem-forming suffix //-e? /// and by //hó? // //hóp' //
elsewhere. The stem-forming suffix is represented by //-0 //
after the numeral roots //xún // one and //čá?p¹ // two.
That is, where * //xún-e? //, * //čá?p¹-e? //, and *//hó?-e? //
are expected by analogy with other forms, //xún-Ø//, //čá?p¹.
Ø//, and //hóy-e? // occur: //óš-e? kíntal// three hundred-
weights, but //xún-Ø kíntal // one hundredweight, //čá?p¹-Ø
kíntal // two hundredweights, and //hóy-e? kíntal // five hun-
dredweights.
The numeral two is represented by //čá? // before numer-
