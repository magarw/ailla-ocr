structions, however, is sufficient to allow the establish-
ment of a substantive form class.
Adjectives are generally of the shape ///CVC //; one root,
//yá?š // green, has a //CVC // shape. While adjectives in
general share with substantives inflection for person but not
for tense and aspect, they differ in potential derivation by
the suffix //-p¹ // to form intransitive verb stems. A large
sub-set of adjectives--those which describe colors--occur
with unique derivational suffixes to form intransitive verb
stems which describe color changes.
Numerals are of the shapes //CVC //, //CVCVC //, and
//CVCCVC //. They may occur underived with affixes of person,
but not with affixes of tense and aspect, and are distinguished
from all other form classes by their occurrence with a unique
set of derivational suffixes to form names of time periods.
and cycles. Syntactically, numerals are distinguished by
their occurrence, underived, immediately before numeral clas-
sifier stems. The Chuj numeral system is vigesimal, built
the distinction of zero and nineteen basic units, with the ex-
tension of the system past these basic units being based on
cycles of twenties. Numeral roots, however, exist only for
numbers from one to twelve, for twenty,
one to twelve, for twenty, and for four hundred.
The remaining numbers are represented by compound stems.
Specifiers form a small sub-class of nouns. With the
three exceptions //wïN // male being, //k'inal// rain, and
//aN // kind of plant, these fifteen morphemes are homophonous
with certain substantives. However, as specifiers they are
