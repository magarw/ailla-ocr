phrases //há? tik né?ik // today and //há? šoh hep¹-íš // the
female animate beings. The phrase today normally would ap-
pear in the pre-posed adverbial position, not in the topic
phrase position. This sentence, however, occurs in the con-
text of a discussion of changing practices in the salt mines,
following a series of sentences which may be glossed in the
past, the pots were large, but today it's not that way; it has
changed. The abnormal appearance of the adverbial in the
topic phrase position is apparently for purposes of emphasis.
The second example contains the topic phrases //há?
hep'-wIN c-Ø-léč-an-k'é?-tah xún // those men who dip up the
liquid (salt) and //séntáwuh // cent. Both phrases are direct
objects of the verb phrase //c-6-ko-túp // we pay someone or
we pay something, although in English the first phrase must
be glossed as an indirect object.
Pre-posed Adverbial Phrase Position
The pre-posed adverbial phrase position is filled by a
particle phrase or a noun phrase. Noun phrases which occur in
this position are usually either embedded sentence noun phrases
prefixed by //há? //, or locative noun phrases prefixed by
//t'ah // // t'ay //.
Examples of phrases in the pre-posed adverbial phrase
position are: //há? hin tík ‡ tóh Nex ‡ c-hin-p'éy-ek'-ih //
me, I am just wandering around, containing the pre-posed ad-
verbial phrase //tón Nex // only; //'éntónseh ‡ más Nex ‡ c-6-
p'át ‡ t'ah k-'íp'-aN // then we have more trouble, literally,
