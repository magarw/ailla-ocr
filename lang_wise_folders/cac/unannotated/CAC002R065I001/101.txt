morphic //il// suffix described above. Note, however, that
the //il// ~ //al// suffix is manifested as //il// only after
a preceding vowel //a//, and as //al// elsewhere. Examples
of the derivation of stems with //il// ~ //al// are: //pétan-
il/ in lot-like measures < //pétan // plot of land, //čóx¹-
al // finely ground substance < //čók¹ // fine powder, //tí?-
k'ák'-il// something taken from the edge of a fire < //ti?://
edge and //k'ák' // fire, //s-kélem-tak-il čóN-ap' // the young
men of a village < //kélem // young man and //čón-ap' // vil-
lage,
//s-čá?p¹-x-ih-al// every two days <` //čá?p¹-x-ih // two
days ago < //čá?p¹ // two, //s-čáˆp'-tak-il k'úh-al// every
two days < //čá?p'-tak // two each and //k'úh // day
//em // derives noun stems from verb roots. Examples
of this derivation are: ///úk¹-em // corn gruel < transitive
verb root //?úk' // to drink something, //úk'-em // paint <
intransitive verb root // ?úk' // to be painted.
//i-CVC //, reduplication of the root after a connective
//i//, derives three noun stems, one of which is based on a
positional root, the other two of which are based on other-
wise unattested roots. The three noun stems are: //k'ár-i-
CVC // noisemaker (of the type which employs a ratcheted gear
rotating against a leaf spring) < *//k'ár //, //rúm-i-CVC //
bullroarer < *//rím //, //súr-i-CVC // whirly-gig (weather-
vane-like constructions of wind-driven propellors and wheels)
< positional root //súr // whirling around.
//iN // derives one noun stem from a positional root:
//ták-iN // dry < //ták // dry.
