have sat down, but I didn't, //'ém-ok-ač-lax k'óx-an // you
should have sat down, but you didn't. Compare with these
forms the stative and verb phrases //k'óx-an-in-?ém-(ih) //
I am seated and ///c-hin-?ém k'óx-an // I sit down.
men,
Stative suffix position +8 contains the suffix //hep' // ,
which marks the plural of a third person subject. This affix,
however, has only been observed in constructions where it is not
clear that the //hep¹ // is in fact a stative suffix. Following
//áy //, for instance, //hep' // has only been observed to occur
if a specifier noun follows: //?áy-Ø-hep' wẤN // there are those
which may also be analyzed as //áy- hep '-wẤN //, where
the //hep' // is the plural inflection of ///wíN // male animate
beings. Following nouns and noun phrases, however, ///hep' //
occurs in what appear to be unambiguous constructions: //k'éš-
aN k'ap ¹-Ø-hep' // they are left-handed //k'éš-aN k'áp'//
left hand or left-handed person. In the absence of conflicting
data, //hep' // is considered here to be a stative suffix, and
its position relative to other suffixes is postulated by anal-
ogy with verbal suffix positions.
Stative suffix position +9 contains the intransitive
verb clitic //(ih) /// which occurs only after a preceding in-
transitive verb root. As stative inflection, this clitic oc-
curs after a preceding inflection for repetition with //páš //
or for directional motion with one of the intransitive verb
roots described on page 141. The clitic //(ih) // does not
occur as //ih// if another phrase follows in the same sentence.
