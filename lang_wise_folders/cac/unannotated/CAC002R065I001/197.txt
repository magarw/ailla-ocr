numeral noun (n), specifier noun (sp), intransitive verb (iv),
transitive verb (tv), positional (pos), stative (st), and par-
ticle (p). The phrases marked are noun phrase (NP), verb
phrase (VP), stative phrase (SP), and particle phrase (PP).
In the analyses of sentence structure, these phrases are
marked according to their sentence function as introductory
phrases (Intro), topic phrases (Topic), pre-posed adverbial
phrases (Pre-Adv), main phrases (Main), object phrases (Obj),
subject phrases (Subj), post-posed adverbial phrases (Post-
Adv), and sentence clitic (Clitic). Sentences are marked S;
the structures of embedded sentences are analyzed in the same
format as the enclosing sentences. Lines connect related el-
ements in the different levels of analysis. Where morphs
have no appropriate gloss (as in the case of most suffixes)
an asterisk appears in the gloss. Lines of dashes connect
linked sentences.
The third and fourth texts are the initial fragments
of longer texts. The third text is the beginning of an auto-
biography of the major informant. The fourth text is the
first of a series of coyote-rabbit stories related by a
speaker from Patalcal (/pát ?álkál/), a Chuj-speaking hamlet
located about ten kilometers northwest of San Mateo Ixtatán,
in the municipio of San Mateo Ixtatán. The third and fourth
texts are presented in a format similar to that used in the
presentation of the second text, but without the internal
analysis of embedded sentences, which are marked simply as
noun phrases, and without structural trees.
