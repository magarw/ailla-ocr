are borrowed from Spanish vary considerably in length and syl-
labic composition. Since the inventory of Spanish loans is an
open and constantly changing set which varies from informant
to informant (and a root may take a variety of more or less
assimilated shapes in the speech of a single informant), no
attempt will be made here to summarize borrowed root shapes.
In general, however, borrowed roots differ from their Spanish
sources in alteration of vowel quality and in reduction or
other alteration of consonant clusters.
CVC Roots
The inventory of twenty-two consonants and five vowels
which occur in native Chuj roots makes possible a total of
2,420 different CVC roots. Of these possible roots, at least
936 have been attested in texts or in elicitation. In the
attested roots, the vowel /i/ occurs 206 times, /e/ occurs
180 times, /a/ occurs 244 times, /o/ occurs 195 times, and
/u/ occurs 211 times. The combinations of consonants which
occur in these roots are shown in Figure 4. There appear to
be no restrictions on the selection of vowels which may occur
in a given C₁-C₂ frame. An analysis of the inventory of these
frames, however, shows some regular patters on non-occurrence
of consonant combinations:
(1) Plain stops and affricates other than /p'/ do not
occur as C₁ in a C₁ VC2 root which has as C₂ a stop or affri-
cate which differs from C₁ only in glottalization.
