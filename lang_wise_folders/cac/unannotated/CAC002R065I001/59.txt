The roots of CV₁²VC shape appear to be developments of
an earlier Proto-Mayan *CV?C_root shape (Terrence S. Kaufman,
personal communication). However, these roots appear to be of
two types in modern Chuj: (1) those which reduce to CVC except
before open juncture, and (2) those which remain CV?VC in all
positions. The fact that not all CV, ?V, C roots reduce to CVC
in non-final positions was not noticed until the final days of
field work, and consequently the complete inventory of stable
CV VC roots cannot be specified at present. Appendix B lists
the CV₁²V₁C roots which are known to reduce to CVC, those
which are known not to reduce, and those which were not checked.

It is possible that the instable CV₁²V₁C Chuj roots (those
which reduce to CVC) are developments of Proto-Mayan *CV?C

roots, while the stable CV₁²V₁C Chuj roots developed from bi-
morphemic Proto-Mayan *CV?VC forms.

Of the 484 possible CV₁VC roots, only seventy-five
roots have been attested. These roots show sixty-six of the
possible combinations of initial and final consonants; the
attested combinations are shown in Figure 5. The number of
attested forms is too small to give decisive data on restric-
tions of consonant co-occurrence, but it should be noted that
none of the attested consonant: combinations are such that they
could not also occur in CVC roots. The infrequency of CV₁²V10
roots ending in glottalized consonants is probably related to
the Proto-Mayan *CV?C origin of this root shape. Note that
none of the attested CV₁³V₁C roots end in the phonemes /? t'
k' r/.
