W
//ih// in verbal suffix position +1 after an intransitive verb
stem derived with a single consonant-- //p' //, //w//, //k//, and
so on. This distribution prevents the formation of tri-conso-
nantal clusters that otherwise might occur: //pay-w-ih-Năl // to
dry maize, for instance, rather than *//páy-w-Năl // . Note that
if //in// occurs in verbal suffix position +1. another instance
of //ih // may still occur in verbal suffix position +10 if the
stem is further inflected for repetition or directional motion.
The suffixes //(ih) // and //ok // doubt have identical distribu-
tion with respect to other consonants and following phrases.
Where its occurrence is permitted by these restrictions, how-
ever, //ok // is obligatory after underived intransitive verb
roots or intransitive stems derived from non-verbal roots, if
these are inflected for future inchoative (with ///?ol // in
verbal prefix position -7). The suffix //ok// may also occur
after transitive verb roots derived in //w//; in this case,
//ok // indicates doubt. In environments where both //ih // and
.//ok // may occur,
may occur, the use of
the use of //ok // rather than //ih // indi-
cates doubt.
The suffix //tah// uncertainty occurs with transitive
and intransitive verb roots, and with compound verb stems
based on the intransitive verbs of directional motion (see
page 113). Note that //tah// in compound stems occurs after
the inflected, or first, stem rather than after the whole
compound stem. Tense-aspect inflection of a stem inflected
by //tah // must be with ///š// durative in verbal prefix po-
sition -8.
