Inflection of Stative Stems
It is convenient to recognize two types of stative
stems which have in common inflection for person by suffix-
ation. The first type of stative stem consists of the stative
root //áy //, either underived or derived in ///an // . The sec-
ond type of stative stem includes all other stative stems (see
page 100).
The stative root //áy // is more fully inflected
than stems of the second type, but where the inflection of the
two types overlaps it is identical.
Stative Prefixes
Stative prefix position -3 contains the negative //ma//.
Inflection with //ma// prohibits inflection for features other
than person. Three forms of stative negatives occur: //ma-?áy // ,
//ma-N-ôk...lax //, and //mâ-lax //. The negative //ma-áy // is
inflected only for third person subjects, with //0/1. The
frame //ma-N-ôk... laxis inflected for personal subjects
other than third person, and for third person subjects as well.
The negative stative //mâ-lax // is inflected only for third per-
son subjects. Examples of these inflections are: //ma-?áy- //
there is none or no, //ma-N-ôk-ON-lax // it is not us, //mâ-
lax-Ø// there is none, //tah toh ma-áy-Ø ?aN ?áN // if there
