ginning in other consonants. The infrequency of clusters
with /b dg r/ can be attributed to the tendency to reduce
clusters in borrowed forms, which in any case would furnish
only a few of the possible combinations.
Post-junctural clusters derive from two sources: (1) a
large number of clusters resulting from the prefixation of
the third person prefix /s/ to noun and verb stems, and (2) a
limited number of clusters found in forms borrowed from Span-
ish. Both types of clusters are limited to sequences of two
consonants, and the theoretically possible clusters of three
consonants which could result from prefixation of /s/ to a
borrowed form do not occur. The prefix /s/ before a consonant
cluster is followed by close juncture: /s+CC/.
All combinations of /sC/ occur except */sč/, */sč¹/,
*/s/, and */sh/, which are replaced by /šč/, /šč¹/, /3/, and
/y/ by regular morphophonemic changes. Post-junctural clus-
ters of Spanish origin are illustrated in the following items:
/Cy/
/wyén/ < Spanish bién; well
/wyáxah/
Spanish viaje; journey
/kyéren/ < Spanish quiere; to want
/syentuh/
/tyempuh/ < Spanish tiempo; era
/ayés/ < Spanish diez; ten
< Spanish ciento; one hundred
/kwáréntah/ < Spanish cuarenta; forty
