Stems formed by //C₁-on // occur either before or after
the inflected stem. If the stem derived in //C₁-on // occurs
before the inflected stem, that stem may be inflected only for
person, by the transitive verb person markers. If the stem
derived in //C₁-on // cccurs after the inflected stem, no re-

strictions on the inflection of that stem occur. After an in-
flected stem, //C₁-on /// is followed by //ok // if no other
phrase follows in the same sentence. Examples of these com-
pounds are: //kót-C₁-on...-p¹át-(ih) // to walk on all fours

person markers. If the stem derived in //CVC // or //CVC-an //
follows the inflected stem, no restrictions on the inflection
of that stem occur. Stems derived in ///CVC-an// are followed
by //ok // if no phrase follows in the same sentence. Examples
of these compound stems are: //lák'-lãk'. . .-?óč-(ih) // to em-
