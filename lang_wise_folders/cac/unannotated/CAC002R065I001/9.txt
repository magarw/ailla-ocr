ANESTHESIENAS
L
ably numbers less than one thousand speakers of Chuj. The
official Guatemalan estimate of the number of Chuj speakers
in that country in 1950 is 10,771 (Dirección General de Esta-
dística 1950: Cuadro 29). This figure is based on an estimate
of the dominant languages in each municipio and not on an ex-
act head count. The actual number of Chuj speakers in Guate-
mala at that time may have been somewhat higher, and the num-
ber at present is surely much higher.
Nearly all of the Indian population of the municipios
of San Mateo Ixtatán and San Sebastián Coatán speak Chuj.
Perhaps half of the Indian population of the municipio of
Nentón speak Chuj. In 1950, according to the Guatemalan cen-
sus (Dirección General de Estadística 1950: Cuadro 2), the
Indian population of these three municipios totaled 16,149
(Table 1). Of these Indians, 13,798 were reported to speak
an Indian language in the home (Dirección General de Estadís-
tica 1950: Cuadro 30). The official estimate of 10,771 Chuj
speakers in 1950 is thus reasonable, but perhaps slightly low.
