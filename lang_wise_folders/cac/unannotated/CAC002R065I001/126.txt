The negatives of expressions inflected with //iš // or
//// are usually formed with //ma-x //; those of ///c// or // š //,
with //ma-š // . Negatives of expressions inflected with ///?ol //,
//wan //, and //wal // in verbal prefix position -7 are usually
formed with //ma-N-?ol //; //ma-N-wan-ok-lax //; and //ma-š-wal //
or //ma-N // or //ma-x //, respectively. Thus, both //N // and
//š// may occur before another tense-aspect marker in verbal
prefix position -7 in negative expressions. The combinations
//ma-N-wan-ok-lax // and //ma-N-?ol// are frequent; the combi-
nation //ma-š-wal // has been observed only once. Other tense-
aspect markers apparently do not occur in verbal prefix position
-8 if another tense-aspect marker occurs in verbal prefix posi-
tion -7. Examples of these tense-aspect markers are: //?iš-
hin-p'át-(ih) // I went (a while ago), //c-hin-p'át-(ih) // I'm
going or I go (now), //š-hin-čín // I said, //š-hač-hin-mák '-
tah// it could be that I am going to hit you, //ma-x-hin-p'át-
lax // I didn't go, //ma-N-?ol-hin-p'át-lax // I won't go, //-
hač-p'át-(ih) // you went, //ma-N-wan-ok-lax-hin-p'át-(ih) //
I'm not going, //ma-š-wal-ø-k'ún-p'-(ih)-lax // he doesn't tire.
Verbal prefix position -9 contains the negative prefix
//ma //. The occurrence of //ma // in this position requires
//lax // at the end of the verb phrase, in verbal suffix posi-
tion +8, or, if the phrase is inflected with //wan // in verb-
al prefix position -7, //lax // is required after //wan-ok //
(see page 120). Examples of inflection for negation are:
//ma-š-hin-p'át-lax /// I'm not going, //ma-x-hin-p'át-lax //
I didn't go or I wasn't going, //ma-š-hůl-heš-w-?íl-lax // I'm
