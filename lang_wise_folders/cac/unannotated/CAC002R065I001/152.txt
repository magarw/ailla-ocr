fier nouns, and may never be an uninflected numeral root.
The maximum complexity of noun phrases is represented by
noun phrases which are or contain embedded sentences; these
sentences may in turn contain other noun phrases with embed-
ded sentences. The major types of noun phrases are discussed
below.
Simple Noun Phrases
Simple noun phrases consist of a single noun stem,
which may or may not be inflected. Examples of simple noun
phrases are found in the discussion of the inflection of noun
stems, pages 130-134.
Specifier Noun Phrases
Any noun which is related to a specifier--any one of
the members of a lexical class whose taxon is a specifier--
may be preceded by that specifier to form a specifier noun
phrase. If the noun stem is inflected by prefixes, those
prefixes follow the specifier. Similarly, any noun phrase
which does not already begin in a specifier, whose head or
referent is a noun related to a specifier, may be preceded
by a specifier noun root to form a specifier noun phrase.
Likewise, an embedded sentence which does not already begin
in a specifier, whose referent is a noun related to a speci-
fier, may be preceded by a specifier root to form a specifier
phrase. The specifier root may also be inflected for plural
(see page 134). Examples of specifier noun phrases are:
//nok' čítam // pig, composed of the specifer //nčk' // animal
