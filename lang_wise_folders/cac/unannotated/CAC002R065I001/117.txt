The third type of compound verb stem consists of an
intransitive verb stem, usually one of the intransitive verbs
of directional motion (see page 62), and a second intransitive
verb stem based on a positional root or a noun root, derived
in //n-ax //, //V1-x //, //V1-x-up' //, //C₁-on //,
01-0
////,
//CVC-an //, or //cvc // . Inflection of the compound stems is
by inflection of the verb of directional motion, not by in-
flection of the derived intransitive stem.

Some of the derived intransitive stems may occur either
before or after the inflected stem, others occur only before
or only after. Likewise, different restrictions occur on the
inflection of the inflected stem, depending on what type of
derived stem occurs in the compound and whether the derived
stem occurs before or after the inflected stem.
Stems derived in //n-ax-(ok) // occur only after the in-
flected stem. The inflected stem is inflected as an intransi-
tive verb stem, and no restrictions hold on its inflection.
The suffix ///ok// occurs
occurs on the second stem only if there is
no following phrase in the
in the same sentence. Examples of this
type of compound verb stem are: //p'át-xéN-n-ax-(ok ) // to fly
//p'át // to go and //xéN // with spread limbs, //k'é?-c'éx-
n-ax-(ok) // to cry, choking off cries and then beginning again
< //k'é? // to rise and the positional root ///c'éx// shouting
excessively, //?él-čék '-n-ax- (ok) // to fall over halfway
//él// to leave and the positional root //čék' // sloped,
//k'é?-c'ít-n-ax-(ok) // to jump about briskly < //k'é? // to
rise and the noun root ///c¹it // slap with the open hand.
