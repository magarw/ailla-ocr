derives verb stems from positional roots. These derived
stems must be further derived either with //x// or with //x//
and //up' //, forming intransitive verb stems. Examples of
these derivations are: //két-Vl-x-(ih) // to be barely able to
//két // barely able to walk, //wáč-V1-x-up'-(ih) // to
make a dry crunching noise < //wáč // very dry.

//C₁///, reduplication of the initial consonant of the
root, derives verb stems from positional roots. The derived
stems must be further derived, either with //on// to form in-
transitive verb stems, or with ///um // to form noun stems. The
noun stems formed with //C₁-um /// occur only in compound stems
with the noun root //p'áh// self. Examples of these derivations
are: //wít'-C₁-on-(ih) /// to quiver < // wit' // jerking suddenly,
//rém-C₁-on- (in)// to walk like a pot-bellied person
on-(ih)
< //rém //
pot-bellied, //cáy-C₁-um-p'áh// objects stuck together
//cáy// sticky.

form intransitive verb stems. Examples of these derivations
are: //áw-t-ex // to call someone < substantive noun root
