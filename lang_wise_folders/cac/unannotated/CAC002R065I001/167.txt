Topic Phrase Position
The topic phrase position is filled by a noun phrase
which spells out in some detail the nature of a topic to
which reference is made in a latter phrase position in the
sentence. The topic phrase, for example, may be a complex
noun phrase including an embedded sentence noun phrase which
furnishes details about the subject of the independent sen-
tence; the subject of this independent sentence may be indi-
cated only by an affix in the verb phrase.
Topic phrases may be related to subject or object af-
fixes in the following verb or stative main phrase, or to noun
phrases in the subject or object phrase positions. Less fre-
quently, topic phrases may be related to other phrases in the
sentence. Two topic phrases which do not have the same refer-
ent may occur in the same topic phrase position.
Examples of topic phrases are found below. In each ex-
ample the topic phrase is identified and glossed, and the re-
lated phrase or affix which occurs later in the sentence and
which has the same referent as the topic phrase is also identi-
fied and glossed. Examples of topic phrases and related sub-
ject phrases are: //há? wín čí? # ma-š-wal-Ø-k'ún-p'-ih-lax //
that man doesn't get tired, containing the topic phrase //há?
wíN čí? // that man there, related to the subject prefix 118 11
