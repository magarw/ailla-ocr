testation of the hypothetical CVC roots
roots on which these forms
could be based, they are here considered to be mono-morphemic.
Note that a large percentage of these forms are plant and
animal names. Further investigation of Chuj ethnobotany and
ethnozoology may lead to the identification of new roots,
allowing the analysis of these CVCVC forms as bi-morphemic.
Trisyllabic Roots
1
A few trisyllabic roots occur. With the exception of
//tótoro? // Adam's apple, //méxme?eč // slingshot, and numerous
borrowings from Spanish, these roots are each represented by
two phonemic shapes, CVCV₁²V₁C alternating with CVCVC; that
is, they alternate between trisyllabic and bisyllabic patterns.
These roots are written as //CVCV°C // in morphophonemic tran-
scription (see Root Shape Alternation, page 67). The known
examples of this type are:
//tók'o?š // flower of Cucurbita ficifolia (Guatemalan
Spanish chilacayote) and possibly other related species
//čáka?N // deaf person
//cóx k'íno?š // a kind of bird
//?íši?č // a kind of bean
//áka?N // hornet larvae
//p'ére?č // hen with few feathers
//c'áka?N // boundary marker
//c'óma?n // Ceonothus coeruleus Lag. and possibly
other related species
//k'áši?l // wing
//k'óšo?č // land snail
