PANTOLERANTES,
ized stops are either implosive or glottalized before vowels.
Plain (non-glottalized) stops are lightly aspirated before
vowels. Voiced stops are neither aspirated, implosive, nor
glottalized, but they may be pre-nasalized after open juncture
and before vowels.

Affricates are generally unreleased (except through
their fricative segments) before consonants or close juncture,
and they are released into voiceless high central vocoids be-
fore open juncture. Glottalized affricates have glottal con-
striction over their segments. Plain affricates are lightly
aspirated.

Voiceless continuants show some assimilation to the

Vowel Clusters
Vowel clusters are limited, and appear to derive from
two sources: (1) stylistic loss of intervocalic // which is
morpheme-final in bi-morphemic forms, and (2) borrowing of
forms having vowel clusters in other languages. One item
which shows a vowel cluster but is apparently neither a loan
nor derived from a form with // is the hailing cry /keréoh/.
Vowel clusters which have been observed are /ie ia io
ae au ou ui ue/. The following forms illustrate these clus-
ters and their sources.
/ie/
/siéntoh/ < Spanish ciento; one hundred
