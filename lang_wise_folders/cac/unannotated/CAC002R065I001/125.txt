(see the discussion of //ok // in that position for details).
Inflection of stems with //wan-(ok-lax) // requires the person-
al subject inflection to be with the transitive verb person
markers; a transitive verb stem inflected with //wan-(ok-lax ) //
is always suffixed with //an-(ih) //. If inflection for nega-
tion is also present, //wan// is followed immediately by //ok-
lax //; otherwise, the //ok-lax // is absent. Examples of these
inflections are: ///?ol-hoN-p'át-ok // we will go, //?o1-Ø-s-
páy-ex // he will dry it with heat, //ol-hin-čám-el-(ih) //
will die, //wan-6-k-ˆáw-an-(ih) // we are planting it, //ma-N-
wan-ok-lax-hin-xá?-š-(ih) // I am not coming, //wan-ko-lú?m-
aš-(ih) // we are getting dirty, //wal-hoN-ló?-C₁-on-
·(ih) // we
are (were) chatting, //wan-ko-lú?m-aš-(ih) Piš-hoN-y-?íl-an-
(ih) // while we were getting dirty, he saw us.
Verbal prefix position -8 contains the tense-aspect
markers //iš // past inchoative, //c// present inchoative,
//š// durative, //// punctual, //x// negative past durative,
//N // negative future or progressive durative. The prefixes
//?iš //, //c //, and //// occur only if inflection for nega-
tive is absent; that is, they occur only in positive expres-
sions. The prefixes //x// and //N// occur only after the
negative //ma// in verbal prefix position -9. The prefix
//š// occurs in both positive and negative expressions, but
is limited in positive expressions to (1) those in which
//tah // uncertainty appears in verbal suffix position +1,
and (2) inflections of the verb ///číh// to say used for di-
rect and indirect quotations.
