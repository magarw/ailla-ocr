Formation of Verb Stems
82
Three classes of verb stems are derived by suffixation:
transitive verb stems, intransitive verb stems, and verb stems
of undetermined class. The latter stems may not be inflected
without further derivation, and most may be derived to form
either transitive or intransitive verb stems.

of Undetermined Class
//c // derives verb stems from transitive verb roots.
The derived stems describe repetitive action. Stems derived
with ///c// must be further derived by //it // and ///ex// be-
fore they may be inflected. Examples of this derivation are:
//kál-c-it-ex// to mix something over and over < //kál // to
mix something, //láw-c-it-ex// to fan something over and over
//láw // to fan something.
<
//č // derives verb stems from transitive and intransitive
verb roots. The derived stems indicate completeness of action.
Stems derived by //č// must be further derived before inflec-
tion; further derivation with //it// and //ex// forms a tran-
sitive verb stem, further derivation with ///ax /// forms an in-
transitive verb stem, and further derivation with //im// and
//tak // forms a noun stem. Examples of these derivations are:
//č'íy-č-it-ex // to rip something by pulling off small bits
< transitive verb root //č'íy // to pull off small pieces of
something, //č'íy-č-it-ax-(ih) // to be torn into little bits
< transitive verb root //č'íy // to pull off pieces of some-
thing, //óč-č-ax-(ih) // to fill a thing with one's body, or to
