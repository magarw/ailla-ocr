MEMARSUPISTUMAA
47
MA
/síémpreh/ < Spanish siempre; always, certainly
/déspwés/ < Spanish después; afterwards
/síNkwéntah/ < Spanish cincuenta; fifty
Only one pre-junctural consonant cluster has been observed,
in a form borrowed from Spanish: /mádre máys/ < Spanish
madre maíz, the name of an edible fern.
Clusters of two consonants separated by close juncture
are freely formed, except that */č+č/, */c¹+č/, and */h+C/
do not occur. The first two are replaced by /t+č/ and /t'+č/,
respectively. The */h+C/ clusters do not occur because /h/
does not occur before close juncture; similarly, // may op-
tionally drop before close juncture followed by a consonant.
