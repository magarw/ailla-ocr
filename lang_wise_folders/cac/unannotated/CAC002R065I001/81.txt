Positional Roots

Positional roots are of the shape
of the shape //CVC //, and are dis-
tinguished from other form classes by a number of derivation-
al reduplication processes which occur with no other form
class. There exist many positional roots which are homorgan-
ic with and have similar meanings to transitive verb roots,
but there are also a number of positional roots which have
different meanings from homorganic transitive verb roots, and
other positional roots which have no corresponding transitive
verb root. Positional roots deal with the specification of
shapes, aggregations, and other physical features of objects.
Two sets of positionals may be distinguished.. Distributive
positionals describe features distributed across multiple ob-
jects; non-distributive positionals describe features concen-
trated on a single object. The two contrast most sharply in
the form of derived numeral classifier stems:
//čá?-póc¹-aN lúm // two dents in a clay object;
//čá? // two, //póc¹-aN // numeral classifier for dents in a
soft object, ///lum // specifier for earthen objects
//čá?-píl-aN lú?m // two ball-shaped pieces of clay;
//čá? // two, //píl-aN /// numeral classifier for ball-shaped
objects, //lú?m // specifier for clay or earthen objects
The root //póc' // is a non-distributive positional root;
//píl // is a distributive positional root.
