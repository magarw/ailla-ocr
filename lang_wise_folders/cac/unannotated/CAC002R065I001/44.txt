stress. Syllables which take sentence stress also take high
pitch. On the second syllable before open juncture, pitch is
not predictable on the basis of stress phonemes, but syllables
with weak stress usually take low pitch, and syllables with
strong stress usually take either mid or high pitch. Pitch is
likewise not predictable from stress on the final syllable be-
fore open juncture, as syllables with strong stress usually
take mid or high pitch, but weakly stressed syllables may take
any pitch. Thus, pitch is contrastive only on the two sylla-
bles preceding open juncture, and may be considered to be part
of the contour. In the phonemic transcription of Chuj used
here, the pitch levels of the two pre-junctural syllables are
marked after the open juncture and before the arrow which rep-
resents the pitch glide of the contour. Low, mid, and high
pitch levels are marked //, /²/, and //, respectively. The
following utterances illustrate the pitch phenomena associ-
ated with contours:
Pol.,Potš. ?i.šim. 'ka.vall.
/# ?ol ?óč ?išim káwal #²3 ↑/ The corn

.Pol.,Potš.?i.šim. 'ka.van.
