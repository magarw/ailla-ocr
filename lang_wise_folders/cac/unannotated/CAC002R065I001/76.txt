of the /CVCV²VC/ shape take an assigned strong stress on
their first vowel. The distribution of strong stresses on
polysyllabic loans from Spanish, however, is not predictable.
In general, trisyllabic loans from Spanish forms which have
penultimate stress take strong stress on their first two
vowels in Chuj: Spanish oficio > /?ópísyoh/ office, Spanish
centavo > /séntáwoh/ cent. However, not all such loans are
stressed on the initial syllable: Spanish entonces may be
/?antónseh/ then. Likewise, the penultimate stress is not al-
ways retained in the loan: Spanish naranjas > /náranšá?aš/ a
kind of orange. Thus, each morph must be marked in the lexi-
con for potential stress.
The contrast between strong and weak stress is generally
neutralized in the syllable preceding open juncture. Most
roots and affixes may take either stress in this position,
but a set of loans including /píNkah/ never take strong stress
on the final syllable, even before open juncture.
Thus, four stress marks are employed in morphophonemic
transcription: //'//marks root (or other) vowels which take
strong stress except before open juncture, where they may take
weak stress: //póm // incense,
//póm // incense, //lú?m // land,
//lú?m // land, //sína?n // scor-
pion, ///cíxtum // many, //pókok // powder. Root vowels which
never take strong stress are marked // //: //píNkàh // planta-
tion, séntáwòh // cent. Unmarked vowels take weak stress ex-
cept before open juncture, where they may take strong stress.
In addition, obligatory specification of stress in construc-
tions is marked as follows: //^// marks obligatory strong stress,
