Canonical Shapes and Morphophonemics
Morpheme Shapes
Roots and affixes in Chuj have different but partially
overlapping sets of canonical forms. Roots are monosyllabic
or longer; the longest native roots are trisyllabic, but loan
forms from Spanish may be longer. Affixes are monosyllabic or
shorter; the shortest are single consonants.
Root Shapes
The majority of Chuj roots are monosyllabic roots of the
1
shape CVC.
Native roots of the shapes CV(C)CVC, CV₁xV₁C, and
X
Previous citation of forms has been made in phonemic
transcription enclosed in single slashes. Citation of roots,
stems, and affixes, in the discussion of morphology and syntax,
is often made in a morphophonemic transcription enclosed in
double slashes: //šúš //. Each morph is presented in its as-
sumed base shape--a series of morphophonemes which underlie its
possible phonemic representations. The phonemic representa-
tions of a form in given contexts may be predicted from this
shape (see page 60 and following pages). In the morphophonemic
transcriptions, roots and derivational or inflectional affixes
are joined by hyphens, while phrases are separated by single
spaces. The symbols C and V represent any consonantal morpho-
phoneme or any vocalic morphophoneme, respectively, in a man-
ner analogous to the use of these symbols in phonetic and pho-
nemic transcriptions. General formulae which represent a num-
ber of roots or a number of possible root shapes, rather than
a single attested root, are written without slashes: CVC, CiC,
CV?VC. Consonantal or vocalic morphophonemes which must be re-
presented by the same phoneme are given the same numerical sub-
script: CV1²V1C.
