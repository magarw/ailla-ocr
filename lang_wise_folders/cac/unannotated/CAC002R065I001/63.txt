//k'ólo?č // a kind of mushroom

a kind of plant
//sína?n //
scorpion
flower (in general)
// šúma ³k //
//méki?š //
berry (in general)
The similarity of the -VC parts of these forms sug-
gests that perhaps they are CVC roots plus the suffixes
* //-0?š //, * //-V?N //, * //-V?č //, * //-a?n //, * //-i?l //,
* //-aºk //, and * //-i?š // . Some of the CVC roots which would
be left by such an analysis actually have been attested as
noun or positional roots. Their derived forms are:
for bird-hunting
//p'ér-an //
naked above the waist
//c¹ák-an // stones used in the construction of shelters
//c¹óm-om-ih // wilted
//k'ól-an // ball-shaped
//tók'-an //
oversize
At least the positional root //p'ér // has a meaning
similar to that of the hypothetical root in //p¹ére?č //, and
the roots //c¹ák //, //c¹óm //, and //k'ól // have what could
be meanings similar to those of the hypothetical roots in
//c¹áka?N //, //c¹óma?n //, and //k¹ólo?č //. Likewise, the
form //?íši?č // may be related to /?íšim/ maize, if both are
based on a root * //?íš // . On the other hand, //?íši?č // may
be a compound of /íšim/ maize and /?íč/ chile pepper which
has been shortened and re-analyzed as a //cvcv?c // root.
Similarly, //k'áši?1// wing and //k'óšoîč // land snail may
