pect without derivation of the root. That is, a verb root
may occur as a verb stem without derivational affixation.
Most transitive verb roots are unambiguously identi-
fied by their co-occurrence with the clitic //-hv? // .
//-?Vh// (see pages 62-63). A small group of roots share
the derivations and inflections of this set of transitive
roots, but do not occur with these clitics. When otherwise
underived, this second set of transitive roots are suffixed
with //-ex //. Some transitive verb roots occur both with
the clitics and with //-ex // .
Intransitive verb roots are unambiguously identified
by their co-occurrence with the clitic //-ih // without deri-
vation of the root.
Noun Roots
Noun roots are of the shapes //CVC //, //CV°C //,
//CVCVC //, //cvcvºc //, and //cvccvc // (other than Spanish
loans). Four sub-classes of nouns are distinguished by in-
flectional and derivational criteria: substantive, adjective,
numeral, and specifier.
Substantives are difficult to characterize, as they in-
clude many minor sub-sets. In general, substantives are roots
which, when underived, may be inflected for person but not for
tense or aspect. Syntactically, most substantives may be im-
mediately preceded by a specifier. However, there are some
substantives which do not occur inflected for person, and
some which cannot be preceded by a specifier. The occurrence
of the overwhelming majority of substantives in these
