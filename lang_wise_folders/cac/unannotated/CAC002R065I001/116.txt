derived by //an// or //n-aš //--the latter forming passive
stems--and a following intransitive verb stem. The intransi-
tive verb stem is further derived in ///ok // if the absence of
//ok // would result in a pre-junctural consonantal cluster,
or if no other phrase follows in the same sentence. The com-
pound stem is inflected by inflecting the first member of the
compound. Examples of the derivation are: //ak'-xéN-w-ok //
to cause something to fly < //?ák' // to do something and
//xéN-w// to fly ‹ positional root //xéN // with spread limbs,
//ªák'-an-k'é?-w-an-ok // to cause something to rise (usually
referring to the hoeing of a field) < //?ák' // to do something
and //k'é?-w-an // to rise < //k'é? // to rise, //ák¹-n-aš-
Páčan-w-ok // to be caused to bathe < //?ák' // to do something
and //'áčan-w// to bathe < unattested positional stem *//?áč-
an // wet, which occurs only in the form //ˆáčan-há? // wet, com-
pounded with //há? // water.
The incorporation of borrowed Spanish infinitives into
the Chuj verb system is accomplished through the formation of
compound verb stems consisting of the root //ák' // to do some-
thing, which may optionally be derived in //an//, and the Span-
ish infinitive. Examples of the derivation are: //'ák'-an-
déspédir // to take one's leave < //ˆák¹ // to do something and
//déspédir// to take leave of someone < Spanish despedir,
//ák ¹-gánar // to
-gánar // to earn something < //ªák' // to do something
and //gánar /// to earn something < Spanish ganar, //ák ¹-an-
kónségir // to obtain something < //'ák' // to do something and
//kónségir // to obtain something < Spanish conseguir.
