ed by several morphs whose selection is conditioned by the
vowel and by the final consonant of the root. Following a
root-final ////, the morphs are of the shape //Vh//; else-
where they are //hv? // . After one of the vowels ///i e a// in
the root, the vowel of the morph which represents the clitic
is //a//; following ///o// in the root, the vowel is ///o// ;
following ///u// in the root, the vowel is //2.//. The follow-
ing forms illustrate this selection of morphs:
/p'í'ah/ < //p'í?-?ah // to take kinks out of something
/p'íha?/ < //p'íh-ha? // to stretch something
/tíwa?/ < //típ'-ha? // to carry something cylindrical
/mésa?/ < //més-ha? // to sweep something
/čá?ah/ < //čá?-?ah // to receive something
/čáka?/ < //čák-ha? // to mistreat someone
/p¹ó?on/ < //p¹ó?-?oh // to fix something
/p'ólo?/ < //p'ól-ho? // to roast something
/c¹ú²un/ < //c'ú?-?uh // to chew sugar cane
/c'úlu?/ < //c'úl-hu? /// to peel something
No //Cé? // transitive verb roots have been attested.
The morpheme which inflects verbs for repetition of ac-
tion is represented by //iš // after a consonant other than
//č // or //1//, and before a consonant or juncture; by //iš //
or //š// after //č // or //1//; and by ///š// elsewhere. This
selection of morphs is illustrated in the following forms:
/?óčiših/ < //?óč-iš-ih // to enter again
/?ótšin/ < //ª?óč-š-in// to enter again
/?éliših/ < //?él-iš-ih // to leave again
