The days from now morpheme is represented by //-íš //
after //hóp' // five and //húkup' // seven, and by //-éx //
elsewhere: //hóp'-íš // five days from now, //húkup '-íš //
seven days from now, //xúnk¹-éx// twenty days from now.
The days elapsed morpheme is represented by //-š //
after //hóp' // five; by //-íš // after //húkup' // seven; by
//-x // after //čá?p¹ // two, //óš // three, //čón // four,
and //wák¹ // six; and by //-éx // elsewhere: //hop¹-š-ih //
five days ago, //húkup'-íš-ih // seven days ago, //čá?p¹-
x-ih // two days ago, //wáxšak'-éx-ih // eight days ago,
//y-hóp'-š-ih-al // every five days, //y-húkup'-íš-ih-al //
every seven days, //s-xún s-čá?-wINk'-éx-ih-al // every twen-
ty-one days.
The morphophonemics of Chuj numeral constructions are
thus rather complex, but historically interesting. The forms
//xúnk' // and //wĩNk' // and the suffix //-iN // may have their
origins in a re-analysis of forms such as * //xúnak-k'íN // twen-
ty-day or * //xún-k'íN // one twenty-day period and *//wínak-
k'ẨN // twenty-day or *//wiN k'ẤN // male being-day, as contem-
porary Chuj //k'ÍN // festival is cognate with a number of items
meaning day in other Mayan languages--festivals commonly being
held every twenty days. The analysis of //xúnk' // and
//w£NK' // as contemporary mono-morphemic forms is based on their
occurrence without //-iN // in constructions like //s-xúnk ¹-éx-
ih-al // every twenty days and //s-xún s-čá?-wÌNk¹-éx-ih-al
every twenty-one days.
