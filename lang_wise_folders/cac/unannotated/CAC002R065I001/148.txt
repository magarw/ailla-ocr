Order of Stative Affixes
Stative stems are inflected for no features for which
verbal stems may not be inflected. The two inventories of in-
flectional affixes are similar. The order of the affixes,
however, differs significantly. Inflection for personal sub-
ject, reportative, and interrogative is prefixed to verbal
stems but suffixed to stative stems. On the other hand, in-
flection for repetition, directional motion, and negation is
similar for both sets of stems. The order of the stative af-
fixes with respect to the stem and with respect to each other
is charted in Figure 8.
