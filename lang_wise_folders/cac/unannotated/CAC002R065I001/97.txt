//up' // derives noun stems from transitive verb roots.
//up' // also derives what may be noun stems from positional
roots and from positional roots derived in //Vl-x // . The
stems derived with //V1-x-up' // occur as adverbials or as in-
transitive verb stems. The stems derived in //up' // from
positional roots must be further derived in //taN-ex//, form-
ing transitive verb stems. Examples of these derivations are:
//xúk-up' // wash trough < transitive verb root //xúk // to
scrape something out, //čúk-up' // hiccups < transitive verb
root //čúk // to snatch and gobble food on the sly, ///wáč-up'-
taN-ex // to spread something out to dry < positional root
//wáč // very dry, //wáč-Vl-x-up'-(ih) // to make a dry crunch-
ing noise < positional root //wáč // very dry.
//um // derives noun stems from transitive and intran-
sitive verb roots, and from verb stems formed from positional
roots or nouns by the suffixation of either //t // or //C₁ // .
Stems other than those derived from transitive verb roots
usually occur in noun compounds, or with the suffix //tak //.
