The two designs are the older lak'an nip, featuring concentric circles of embroidery, and the
more recent kolop' nip, with embroidery featurng a Star of David design (a six-pointed star).
The latter design may have been borrowed from Kanjobal huipils. It is related to the introduction
of lace collars, necessary to cover up the uneven line of embroidery at the neck. Older huipils
stiched in an internal layer of cloth ("servilleta"), a backing for the embroidery, for increased
warmth. More recent huipils are lighter and lack this reinforcement.
