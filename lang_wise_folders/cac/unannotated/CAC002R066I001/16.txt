The demonstrative root ha' is also the pronoun base for ha'on 'I', ha'ach 'you',
etc. Two common frames for noun phrases are ha' N tik 'this N' and ha' N chi' 'that N', e.g., ha
winh tik 'this man', ha winh chi' 'that man'.
exclamExclamations include greetings, calls (to animals and people) and exclamations of
surprise, agreement, etc. Baby talk, words and phrases used by or to infants, is also marked as
exclam. Noun phrases of the CVC-u Bodypart shape (insults) could be considered exclamations.
A small class of roots appear to result from onomatopoeia. This class borders on
paralanguage, and includes imitations of sounds from inanimate sources and animal noises.
A Cautionary Note
onom
Lexical entries are marked with a grammatical classification based on my dissertation
(Hopkins 1967). The the reader is advised that not all of them will be accurate. In many cases I
did not elicit enough information to distinguish between overlapping categories, as discussed
above under vin phrase and stv phrase. Where the data are sufficient to distinguish between the
possibilities, these are marked as stv phrase or vin phrase. Where data are not sufficient, I have
entered my best guess. Forms that were tested and found ungrammatical are marked with
asterisk, e.g., *yachana'.
