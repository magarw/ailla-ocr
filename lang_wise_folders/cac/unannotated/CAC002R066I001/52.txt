'ox t'ilanh, n (k'en). Constellation: The three stars of Orion's belt, Spanish "Las Tres Marías."
See below. This phrase probably originally applied to the triangle formed by a belt star (Alnitak)
and the two knee stars (Saif and Rigel), since t'ilanh means "lines of things" rather than "things
in a line." That constellation has been identified as the Classic Maya "first hearth" (David
Freidel, Linda Schele and Joy Parker, 1993. Maya Cosmos. New York: William Morrow. Pp. 59-
75); note the Orion nebulae M42 and 43, representing the fire in the center of the hearth. The
setting in place of the three stones is described on Quiriguá Stela C and other monuments. The
use of a three-stone hearth, Chuj yokech, is a defining feature of the Mesoamerican culture area
(Paul Kirchhoff, 1943, Mesoamérica. Sus límites geográficos, composición étnica y carácteres
culturales, Acta Americana 1(1):92-107) . See also huke', the Big Dipper, and mo'otz, the
