Grammatical categories and their respective abbreviations are as follows:
n
Noun. In general, "noun" refers to lexical items that can be possessed. Nouns that refer to
physical objects or beings may also be marked for their "essence," i.e., the one (or more) of the
fifteen or so noun classifiers they are associated with (see below). Abstract nouns are not so
marked nor do they have such associations.

The noun classifiers in Chuj and other Mayan languages of the Cuchumatanes
region are a set of lexical items, mostly drawn from nouns. They indicate the essential nature of
the object or being and function syntactically as pronouns and articles, similar to gender
pronouns and articles in languages like Spanish (e.g., article el, pronoun Ã©l, male; article la,
pronoun ella, female). A description of noun classifiers can be found in Hopkins (1967), and a
brief discussion is found in Breedlove and Hopkins (1970:276-8); in these sources they are
referred to as "specifiers." A hypothesis concerning their origin can be found in Hopkins (2012,
In press). While the inventory varies slightly from speaker to speaker, the inventory of noun
classifiers for the major informant is the following:
(winh)
Male humans and personified animals (in folktales), day names and major
illnesses.
