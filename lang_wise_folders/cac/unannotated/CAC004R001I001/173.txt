Post-posed Adverbial Phrase Position
The post-posed adverbial phrase position is filled by
a noun phrase or a series of noun phrases, usually in apposi-
tion. Two phrases not in apposition may occur in the same
post-posed adverbial position; combinations of one adverbial
of time and one of place, and of two adverbials of place, have
been observed. In general, adverbials of time follow adverbi-
als of place if both occur in the same post-posed adverbial
phrase position. Noun phrases which occur in the post-posed
adverbial phrase position are frequently prefixed with //t'ah //
locative. Embedded sentence noun phrases occurring in this
position are frequently based on a main phrase with //'ét' //
