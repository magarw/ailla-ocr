Particle Noun Phrases
153
Any noun phrase other than an embedded sentence may
be either preceded or followed, or both prcede and followed,
by one or more particles. The suffixation of particles has
been mentioned briefly in the discussion of enumerative and
quantitative noun phrases. Particles which are commonly
prefixed to noun phrases are //há? // demonstrative, //t'ah //
//t'ay // locative, //té // intensive, and //más // compara-
tive. Particles which are commonly suffixed to noun phrases
are //šoh// already, //toh // still, and //Nex// only. Ex-
amples of the prefixation and suffixation of particles to
noun phrases are: //más wáč' // better,
//más wáč¹ // better, //wáč¹ šoh// already
well, //té wáč¹ // very well, //té púral // with much diffi-
culty, //há? tá? // in that place, //há hin tík // I, //?íč
· Nex tá? /// in this way alone, //t'ah píNkah // in, to, or from
the plantations, //t'ah xún šoh k'úh tík // on this other day,
//t'ay hin// to me, //t'an tik // here, //há? xún s-ló-C1-on-
el wíN y-?ét' xún wĨN y-?ámíguh wan-c-Ø-xá?-š-(ih) t'ah

Embedded Sentences
A common feature of Chuj syntax is the occurrence of
embedded sentences as noun phrases. These sentences differ
only in simplicity from independent sentences; they are not
preceded by particle phrases or conjunctions, but begin with
the topic phrase or a later phrase (see Sentence Structure).
