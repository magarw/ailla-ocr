Verbal Suffixes
Verbal inflection following the stem involves fewer
morphemes than pre-stem inflection, but the co-occurrence re-
strictions that hold between these morphemes complicate their
description. The inflectional suffixes will be discussed in
groups arranged according to the positions they occupy in verb
phrases. These positions follow the derivational suffixation
discussed in Formation of Verb Stems, pages 82-91. The posi-
tions are numbered successively from +1 (nearest to the verb
stem) to +10 (most distant from the verb stem).
Verbal suffix position +1 contains the suffixes //tah//
uncertainty, //ok// doubt, and the verb stem clitics //(ih) //
and //hV? // ~ //*vn // (described on pages 65-66). The clitic
//hv? // //Vh // occurs only after underived transitive verb
//?vn
roots which are otherwise unsuffixed, and the clitic occurs
only if no phrase follows in the same sentence. The clitic
///(ih) // occurs after intransitive verb stems, derived or un-
derived. However, //(ih) // is realized as //ih// only in cer-
tain environments. First, ///(ih) // is realized as
as //ih// af-
ter intransitive roots or stems if no phrase follows in the
same sentence. This realization of ///(ih) //
//(ih) // occurs either in
verbal suffix position +1 or verbal
suffix position +10, which-
ever is terminal in the stem. Second, ///(ih) // is realized as
