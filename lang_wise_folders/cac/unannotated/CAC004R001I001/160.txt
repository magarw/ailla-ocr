noun phrase, a specifier phrase. That is, the immediate con-
stituents of the example above are ///wIN// male animate being
and //ánimah c-Ø-mún-l-ax-(ih) // man who works. This analy-
sis is reinforced by the occurrence of embedded sentences
which do not begin in a noun phrase but which are preceded
by a specifier noun (unstressed, showing that it introduces
a specifer phrase): //wIN c-6-mún-l-ax-(ih) // man who works,
the immediate constituents of which are //wIN // male animate
being and //c-6-mún-l-ax-(ih) // he works.
The examples of embedded sentence noun phrases which
follow are arranged by the sentence phrase positions in which
they occur: topic, pre-posed advebial, direct object, subject,
or post-posed adverbial phrase positions. These positions are
discussed in Sentence Structure; all are positions which may
be filled by other types of noun phrases. Note that embedded
sentences occur in the topic phrase position only as part of
specifier noun phrases. In the examples which follow, a gloss
of the entire sentence will be given first, followed by the
identification of the embedded sentence and its glosses as
as an
independent sentence and as an embedded sentence.
Examples of embedded sentences in the topic phrase po-
sition, as parts of specifier phrases, are: //há? šoh WIN
?áy-Ø-em-k ¹óč čí? c-Ø-čá?-an lúm// the other man down there
on top receives the earthen pot, containing the embedded sen-
tence //áy-Ø-em-k¹óč-(ih) // he is down somewhere on top of
something which is part of the specifier noun phrase //wIN
?áy-Ø-em-k'óč čí? // man down there on top; //há? hep'-wiN
