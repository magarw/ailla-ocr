//xá?-š-kan-(ih) // to come back again to stay, //ma-N-?ol-
hin-p'éy-ek'-lax // I won't walk around < //p'éy-ek'-(ih) // to
walk around.
Verbal suffix position +9 contains the suffix //hep' //,
which marks the plural of third person subjects. Note that
this is not an obligatory suffix even if the third person sub-
ject is plural; the suffix is optional, and plural need not be
marked in the verb phrase. Examples of the inflection are:
//?iš-Ø-p¹át-hep' // they went, //?ol-s-táN-w-ex-hep' // they will
wait, //c-Ø-táx-n-ih-hep' // they are playing, //ol-y-áw-ex-
paš-hep' // they will plant it again, //ma-x-Ø-ló?-C₁-on-lax-
hep' // they didn't chat.
Verbal suffix position +10 contains the intransitive
verb clitic //(ih) //, the distribution of which was discussed
briefly on pages 122-123. The suffix ///in// occurs only if
there is no following phrase in the same sentence, and only if
the preceding morpheme is either an intransitive verb root
(either as main verb root or as inflection) or inflection for
repetition, or under the conditions described on pages 122-
123. In verbal suffix position +10, //ih// does not occur if
either verbal suffix position +7, +8, or +9 is filled. Examples
of the suffix //ih// are: //c-6-p'át-in// he goes, //c-Ø-p'át-
š-ih he goes again, //c-s-nic-păt-in// he moves it along.
