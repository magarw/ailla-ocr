Enumerative Noun Phrases
Two types of noun phrases involve numeral roots and
stems. The first is composed of a numeral root or compound
numeral stem and a numeral classifier stem. The numeral stem
is optionally suffixed by //tak // distributive or followed by
one of the items //kotak // small, //niw-an // large (singular),
or //níw-ak // large (plural). Examples of this type of enu-
merative noun phrases are: //wák p'éč // six handfuls, composed
of //wák // six and //p'éč // handful; //wák-tak p'éč // six
handfuls each; //čá? kotak pác-aN // two small fiber bundles,
composed of //čá? // two, //kotak // small, and //pác-aN // fi-
ber bundles; //xún níw-an pác-aN // one large fiber bundle;
//čá? níw-ak pác-aN // two large fiber bundles; //čá? pác-aN //
two fiber bundles.
The second type of enumerative noun phrase is composed
of a noun stem derived from a numeral root or stem by the suf-
fixation of //e? // (see pages 97-98), and a following noun
which is one of a set of measures. The stem derived in //e? //
may optionally be suffixed with ///ok// approximately (see
page 99), with particles, especially //Nex// only, //šoh //
already, and //toh // still, or with both //ok// and a single
particle. The nouns in the set of measures which occur in
these enumerative noun phrases are generally borrowed from
Spanish. Examples of this type of enumerative noun phrase
