But while embedded sentences have the same structure as in-
dependent sentences--they may be described in terms of the
sequences of sentence constituents--they are not always
identical to independent sentences. The subject of an em-
bedded sentence occurs in the topic phrase position rather
than in the subject phrase position which follows the verb
or stative phrase. This is the normal order of phrases in
an independent interrogative sentence which employs the
question words //tás // what?, //máč // who?, //p'áx-ti?l //
//áx-ti?1/// where?, and so on. However, it is not the
normal order of phrases in an independent declarative sen-
tence. An independent sentence //c-6-mún-l-ax-(ih) WIN
ánimah t'ah s-wáč¹-k'áp' // a man works with his right hand
will occur as an embedded sentence //wIN ?ánimah c-Ø-mún-1-
ax-(ih) t'ah s-wáč'-k'áp' //, with the subject phrase //WIN
Pánimah // a man in the topic phrase position.
Similarly, phrases which in independent sentences would
appear affixed with particles occur without these particles
in embedded sentences: //t'ah xún yémpuh c-Ø-kót-(ih) yap¹-il
t'ay hóN // in one period sickness comes to us appears as the
embedded sentence //xún yémpuh c-Ø-kót yáp'-il t'ay hóN // a
period in which sickness comes to us.
Many embedded sentences begin in a noun phrase which
is preceded by a specifier noun: //wIN ánimah c-Ø-mún-l-ax-
(ih) // men who work. In these phrases the specifier noun is
best analyzed not as part of the embedded sentence, but as
specifier noun which forms, together with the embedded sentence
a
