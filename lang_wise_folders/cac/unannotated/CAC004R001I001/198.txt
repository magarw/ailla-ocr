Today I'll tell how we work--how we do our work. So
I will tell how we do it. In order to do our work, first we
decide in which month we will do our work--in what season
will do it. First we decide that the maize season will begin
in one or two months, and we (break the sod and) turn the
land. When we turn over the soil, if it is a (formerly) har-
vested field and is now grassland, it is difficult to turn.
Then, two months before (the maize season) we turn the land.
The surface rots. When it is already rotten, we turn the
land again. The maize season begins. If it is fallow land
are working, we look for our brush hook.
