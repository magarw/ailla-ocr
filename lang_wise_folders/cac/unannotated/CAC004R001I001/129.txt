Examples of the inflectional suffixes in verbal suffix
position +1 follow. Note that each suffix in this and in all
other positions is in complementary distribution with other
suffixes listed in the same position--only one suffix of each
set may occur in any given item. The examples are: ///c-hač-
hin-mák '-ha? // I'm hitting you, //c--s-mák' wiN // he hits it,
//š-hač-hin-mák '-tah// it could be that I am going to hit you,
//c-hin-čám-ih // I die, //'ol-hin-čám-ok // I will die, // 201-
hin-čám-el-ih // I will die, //c-Ø-ták-k-ih-páš-ih // it dries
out again, //c-Ø-k'ún-p'-ih wẤN // he gets tired, //ol-ø-k'ún-
p'-ok // he will get tired, //ol-s-mól-ho? // he will gather it,
//ol-s-táN-w-ex-hep' // they will wait for it, //ol-s-táN-w-

//hv? ///, if not also inflected for plural number in verbal
suffix position +3. A few verbs form their imperative by re-
