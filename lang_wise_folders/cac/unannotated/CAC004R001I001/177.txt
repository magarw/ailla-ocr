Style in the Elaboration of Phrases
Sentences with stative phrases as main phrases and sen-
tences with verb phrases as main phrases may both be described
in terms of the same sequences of phrase positions. There
are, however, marked differences in the normal (or most fre-
quent) elaborations of the phrases which occur in some phrase
positions.
In sentences with verb phrases in the main phrase posi-
tion, structurally complex subjects--those with embedded sen-
tences, for example--tend to occur in the topic phrase posi-
tion, and the subject phrase position is usually filled by a
simple construction, often a specifier noun. Direct objects
and adverbials tend to follow the main phrase rather than pre-
ceding the verb phrase in the topic and pre-posed adverbial
positions.
In sentences with stative phrases in the main phrase
position, structurally complex subjects tend to occur in the
subject phrase position rather than in the topic phrase po-
sition. In general, the phrases preceding the stative phrase
are fewer and less complex than those which follow the stative
phrase.
