APPENDIX D
TEXTS
The texts which follow illustrate Chuj phonology,
morphology, and syntax. All texts were first recorded in
conversational situations, then transcribed, analyzed, and
translated. As is to be expected in casual speech, the texts
include hesitations and mistakes; these are ignored in the
morphophonemic, phrase structure, and sentence structure anal-
yses, but are included in the phonetic or phonemic analyses.
The first text is the initial section of a long de-
scription of maize-farming techniques. A phonetic transcrip-
tion of the text (Ph) is accompanied by an interlinear pho-
nemic transcription (P) and an English translation (E). Para-
linguistic junctures of all types are marked with the symbol
// in the phonemic transcription.
The second text is the complete text of a reported
conversation between the major informant and another native
of San Mateo Ixtatán, meeting in Huehuetenango. The text is
given in phonemic transcription (P) with interlinear morpho-
phonemic analysis (MP), identification of root classes (R),
phrase structure (PS), sentence structure (SS), rough glosses
of morphs (G), and English translation (E). The root classes
distinguished are substantive noun (s), adjectival noun (a),
