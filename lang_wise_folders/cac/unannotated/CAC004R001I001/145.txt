first person singular, //ač // second person singular, //01/
third person singular or plural, ///ON// first person plural,
//eš // second person plural. The function of these suffixes
is the same as that of subject specification for verbs. Ex-
amples of the inflections are: //níp'-ap'-il-in // I am a be-
loved person, //k'é?-ok-in líN-an // I am standing up, //p'at-
ok-in k'óx-an // I go over to sit down, //ók¹-in // I cried,
//téN-an téN-an-in // I am short and stupid, //čám-nak-ač //
you are a dead person, //pús-u?-Ní?-ač // you are a person with
an inflated nose, //sík'-p¹-il-ač-?él-(ih) // you are chosen,
//°áy-Ø wỄN ánimah c--mún-1-ax-(ih) t'ah s-wáč'-k'áp'// there

around?, //áy-Ø-hap'-?ek'-(ih) líN-an xun wiN // they say
there was a man standing around.
Stative suffix position +4 contains the suffix //páš //
single repetition (compare verbal suffix position +4, pages
125-126). This suffix apparently occurs only with the stative
root //áy // and not with other types of stative stems. Ex-
