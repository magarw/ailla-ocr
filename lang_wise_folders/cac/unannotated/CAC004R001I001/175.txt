Phrase and Sentence Clitic Positions
Two clitics occur other than the verb phrase clitics
described in Verbal Suffixes, pages 122-123 and 129. These
are the phrase clitic //xún // and the sentence clitic //p'ih-
an //.
The phrase clitic //xún // apparently may occur at the
end of any phrase, but its occurrence is most frequent at the
end of embedded sentences or at the end of sentences which are
independent but which are linked to following sentences by
conjunctions. Examples of //xún //as a phrase clitic are:
//šál ‡ tah ‡ má-?áy-Ø ‡ xún ‡ c-ko-ná?-el-tah // and if not,
we think, in which //xún // is terminal in the sentence //šál ‡
tah ‡ má-?áy-Ø ‡ xún // and if not; //šál ‡ táh toh ‡ c-k-?ák¹ #
/
y-?ís-al ?át-il ‡ xún ‡ tóh Nex ‡ ?áy-ON-?ék ¹-ih // and if we
