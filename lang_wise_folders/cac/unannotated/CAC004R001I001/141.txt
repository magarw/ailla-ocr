than once. The pluralization of distributive positionals
thus implies a plurality of objects which carry the specified
features. On the other hand, the features specified by non-
distributive positionals are such that a given object may have
more than one feature. An object may be dented once, for in-
stance, or it may be dented many times. The pluralization of
non-distributive positionals thus does not necessarily imply
a plurality of objects carrying the features specified. In
fact, there are two plurals for both kinds of positionals.
One plural specifies a plurality of objects, each of which is
singly characterized by the specified feature. The other plural
specifies a plurality of features, which may either be distribut-
ed across many objects, or concentrated on a single object. The
distinction between the two types of positionals is based large-
ly on the fact that for distributive positionals, the two plu-
rals are semantically identical; for non-distributive position-
als they are distinct.
The noun stems derived from positional roots by //u? //
form their plurals by replacing ///u? // with //xap¹ //. These
stems occur almost exclusively in compound stems (see pages 97
and 104); the plural expressed by //xap' // in these compounds
is plurality of the objects showing the features specified by
the positional root. Thus, //púc ¹-u?-Ní? /// pug-nosed (person)
is matched by a plural //púc '-xap¹-Ní? // pug-nosed (persons),
since //Ní? // nose describes an object which is distributed one
to a person. However, the compound stem //léw-xap¹-?ók // bow-
legged (person) has no parallel form * //léw-u?-?ók //, since the
