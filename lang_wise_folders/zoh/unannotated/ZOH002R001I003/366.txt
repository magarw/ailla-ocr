13.1.6.4. Temporal adverbs, deictics, and clauses
These elements have all been discussed in other places adverbs and
deictics in chapter 4, and temporal subordinate clauses in chapter 11.
Appendix B contains a list of words pertaining to time in MIG Zoque (parts of
the day, etc.). This section will just provide some examples of the way they are
used to sequence narrative events and locate events in time.
Since MIG Zoque lacks tense, temporal adjuncts are used to specify the
time of events. In examples (13.26 i-ii), the events are located at exact times
with respect to the time of speaking. In (iii), the temporal adjunct specifies the
sequence of events in the narrative, indicating the passage of time in the story
itself. In (iv-v), the temporal clauses sequence link events in the world of the
narrative: when(ever) the serpent comes burbling out, you run away; the farmer
always burns the field after he clears it.

7 I don't know why this extra agreement marker is here. There are not quite enough of these
examples in the corpus to declare it a sub-pattern of agreement, but they do appear in texts
from many speakers. It could be that the speaker started to just say "we went" and then
decided in mid-utterance to make it an auxiliary phrase.
