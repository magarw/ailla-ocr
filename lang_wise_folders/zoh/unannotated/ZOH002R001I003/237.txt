Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
8.3.2. Functions of the components of verb compounds
Foley & Olson (1985) present a set of characteristics of serial verb
constructions (SVCs) as part of their argument that such constructions
constitute single clauses. Their discussion centers around serial verbs in West
African languages, but they include compound constructions from languages
like Yimas (Papua-New Guinea) that are very much like the MIG Zoque data
described in this section. The description of the various functions served by
MIG Zoque verb compound constructions will be organized around the Foley &
Olson characteristics.
They present three fundamental arguments in favor of the single clause
analysis of SVCs: that in some languages they are a single word, that the
meaning of one of the components may be different in a series than in
isolation, and that one of the components may actually be ungrammatical in
isolation. Verb compounds in MIG Zoque are uncontroversially a single word,
since they take only one agreement marker and one inflectional suffix.
There are several roots that appear frequently in compounds with shifted
meanings, as shown in the examples in (8.20). The root poy- means 'to flee'
when used by itself, generally referring to animals. In compounds, it means
'briefly; for/in a minute' (i-ii). num- by itself means 'to steal'; in compounds, it
means 'secretly' (iii). yoh- by itself means 'to pay'; in compounds, it indicates
reciprocity or repetition (iv-v). witu?- by itself means 'to turn around'; in
compounds, it can mean 'all around; around and around' (vi).
