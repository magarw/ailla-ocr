Morpheme boundary symbols
inflectional affix
derivational affix
compound
clitic
The symbols shown in the table are used to separate morphemes in the
morpheme breakdown line of each data example. They appear on the side of
the larger unit to which the morpheme belongs syntactically. This is illustrated
in the example below. The + that marks a clitic appears on the right of the
person agreement marker ?əy, because it belongs to the verb complex on its
right. This is mirrored by the + that marks ?am as a post-verbal clitic. The
separates two compounded lexemes (ko.wak is clearly a lexicalized form,
because the root wak does not appear in any underived forms in the modern
language). The . is placed between a derivational affix and the verb root; the -
is placed between the root and an inflectional suffix.
