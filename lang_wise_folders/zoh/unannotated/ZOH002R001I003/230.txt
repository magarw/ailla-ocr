Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
More commonly, the events denoted by the two verbs must be
simultaneous -V1 while V2 which makes these constructions more limited
than verb compounding. There are very few examples of this construction in
the texts, and examples for eliciting judgements had to be crafted very carefully
to get the pragmatics right. It seems there are not that many things that can be
done with the strict simultaneity required by this construction. The most
acceptable were those in which the actor was somehow vocalizing while
performing the action.

Either or both verb roots can be transitive in these constructions. There
is only one argument structure, however, and thus there can only be one actor
and one patient. This is why it's easier to construct these with verbs of
speaking: they are generally T1 roots, that only optionally take patient
