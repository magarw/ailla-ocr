The applicative also induces a phenomenon known as external
possession (Payne and Barshi, 1999) or possessor ascension (Aissen, 1987).
Generally, external possession occurs when the undergoer of a clause is
possessed by a first or second person and the actor of the clause is a third
person. The person hierarchy again comes into play, requiring that the more
prominent entity be marked on the verb in preference to the lowly possessed
object. So, we get the first person absolutive agreement marker də or the 3>2
marker mi instead of the expected third person ergative marker ?ǝy.
In example (6.22 i), the first-person possessor of the shirt outranks the
third person agent of the tearing event; hence it is marked with the first person
absolutive marker. Examples (ii - iv) are included to illustrate the limits of this
phenomenon. If I tear my own shirt (ii), the first person agent is of equal rank
with the first person recipient, and so the agreement marker is first person
ergative. (iii) shows that the applicative construction is not obligatory: I can
simply say that my shirt was torn, using the passive form of the verb. Oddly, I
can also say 'my shirt was torn for me', as in (iv), in which both the applicative
and the passive suffixes appear. This is the only circumstance under which two
of the valency-changing suffixes can appear together. Another example of this
type is shown in (v). Example (vi) shows the limits of the possessor-raising: the
shirt belongs to the father that is mine, evidently not sufficiently close to
warrant the external possession construction.
