Table 4.2. The many uses of ney.
The pronominal form of ney also appears in a few idiomatic constructions
such as those shown in (4.17). ney=ci?- is a lexicalized form that means 'to
give as a gift, free and clear'. Since it appears as an ordinary verb stem with
pronominal agreement markers outside the ney, it isn't reasonable to attempt
to squeeze this idiom into the rest of the pattern.
