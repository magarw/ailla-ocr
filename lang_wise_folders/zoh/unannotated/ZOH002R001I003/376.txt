Chapter 14: Discourse
In this chapter, I will give a description of some features of MIG Zoque

various sorts of discourse markers and their functions in structuring narratives.
This set consists chiefly of a variety of terms for 'then' or 'thence', both MIG
Zoque native words and Spanish loan words.

about the narrator's work or daily life, or about some notable event such as a
wedding or the way in which their family's household saint was found. There
are a few fables, including a few that were adapted from Spanish stories;
descriptions of local customs or history; a couple of humorous stories; and two
stories about a well-known raconteur of the previous generation, Satornino.
There are also two long interviews conducted by Sr. Sánchez: one with a

he is a wonderful story-teller, he didn't like to have an audience.
