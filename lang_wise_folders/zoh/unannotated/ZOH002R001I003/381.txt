of other verbs, including other verbs of speaking (such as cam.hay-
(platicar.APPL), 'contar á alguien', commonly used to introduce a story). The
nəm- verbs are used to introduce dialog, which, as mentioned above, often
carries the bulk of a third person narrative. They may appear twice, bracketing
a single quoted clause.

nəm- verbs don't obey the same rules for aspect as other verbs.
Normally, the aspect of a verb is directly related to the factual temporal
character of the event described: completive if the event is over and done with,
incompletive if it is on-going. There are other factors, such as the use of the
incompletive in a narrative set in the past to create a more vivid enactment of
events, but generally, choice of aspect obeys orderly discourse rules. The use
of nəm-, however, seems to lie outside this orderly domain, alternating
between incompletive and completive with no discernible pattern. The two
clauses shown in (14.2) are consecutive in the text. The first 'he' refers to the
lieutenant, who has not yet been specifically introduced, but whose presence
can be inferred from the fact that a group of soldiers (who have been
mentioned) must have a leader. The mysterious aspect alternation shown in
these two examples continues throughout the narrative.
