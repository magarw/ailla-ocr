7.3. Verb formation suffixes
There is one suffix used to create MIG Zoque verbs from Spanish verbs
and Zoque nouns: cək-, 'to do'. There are two versives for forming verbs from
nouns, adjectives, and other words.
7.3.1. Spanish verb stems + the Zoque light verb cək-
—
To import a Spanish verb into MIG Zoque, one strips the inflectional
suffix from the (present tense) Spanish verb (probably the third person singular
form) and compounds the stem with the light (semantically nearly empty) verb
cək-, 'to do'. The argument structure of the combined form is determined by
the Spanish verb. Evidence that the Spanish donor form is the third person
singular can be seen in examples (iv) and (viii), below. Here, the Zoque verbs
were formed from irregular Spanish verbs: conseguir 'to get', and aprobar, 'to
approve'. The third person singular forms for these two verbs are consigues
and apruebes. The irregular vowel alternations of these verbs is reflected in the
vowels in the second syllables of the Zoque words.
