4.1.2. Transitive verbs
Transitive verb roots take two arguments. They are divided into three
classes. The first division is based on the formal requirements for the
appearance of these roots in clauses without an object, in which case they take
absolutive agreement markers. Those that require the antipassive suffix -?oy to
detransitivize them are designated T3 verbs. This class is by far the largest.
Verb roots that do not require a detransitivizing suffix are classified as T1 or
T2, according to whether the subject is construed as an agent or a patient.
T1 verbs do not require a detransitivizing affix to drop an argument.
Many of the verbs in this class are verbs of perception, speaking, ingestion,
cooking, and verbs expressing motions that can be expressed with objects, like
7ec- 'to dance'. (One can dance the fandango, or simply dance.) Given these
semantic classes, it is not surprising that when an argument is dropped, the
remaining argument is the actor. A sample of the verbs in this class is given in
(4.3) and some examples of both transitive and intransitive uses of two typical
members of this class are shown in (4.4).
