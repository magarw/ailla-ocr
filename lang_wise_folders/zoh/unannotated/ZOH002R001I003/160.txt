There are some cases in which the argument added by the applicative
suffix is opaque. (6.23 i) may mean 'He arrived to or for him, maybe'. There's a
clearer usage of this kind shown in (ii). It's possible that the applicative in (iii) is
referencing the locative phrase kocək+ho?, 'in the hills', along the lines of
example (6.22 ii), above. Otherwise, it's quite mysterious: there are no other
actors in this particular stretch of text4.

6.2.3. Passive ?ǝm
In a passive construction the undergoer of a verb becomes the subject
and the agent is suppressed. There are no passive constructions that allow the
overt expression of an agent, in a postpositional phrase or otherwise. It is
really most accurate to say that the passive suffix bleaches all the semantic
features from the agent argument: the thing was done, obviously someone did
4 Sr. Omobono Sánchez Miguel uses the applicative suffix a lot in this text, which is long
interview with him about his healing practices (he is a curandero). Perhaps he uses it because
everything that he talks about is done on behalf of someone else the patient he is treating -
although he doesn't explicitly mention the patient in every clause.
