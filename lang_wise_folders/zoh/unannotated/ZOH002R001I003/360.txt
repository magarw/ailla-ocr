root that contributes the central
In the -way constructions, the verb
meaning of the complex is followed by a second, reduplicated, root. This
second root is most commonly one that means something like 'to cut', but 'to
get' and others also appear5. I don't know what the criteria for choosing one
of these roots over another might be; perhaps it's a function of assonance or
some subtle semantic feature.
5 Note that in example (13.19 iii), only the second syllable of the emphasizing root is repeated.
There are very few two-syllable verb roots in this language, and no others that mean a kind of
forceful action, so I can't conclusively state that this conforms to a reduplication rule or not.
