My deepest and most heartfelt thanks go to Germán Sánchez Morales, my
principal consultant, advisor, caretaker, and dear friend. He is an extraordinary
teacher of languages, with infinite patience and an amazing capacity for
paraphrasing and re-phrasing and interpreting my lousy Zoque accent and my
highly-variable Spanish. "I could speak with a mute!", says Germán, and that is
nothing but the simple truth. He is also a kind, cheerful, good-natured,
intelligent, honest, and hard-working man, who was my collaborator in every
stage of this project. He made this enterprise his own, and this grammar, as
well as the dictionary and the collection of texts, are a testament to his vast
knowledge of and love for his language.
I would also like to thank his wife, Teófila Jimenez Cruz, and his children,
Griselda, Cecilia, Homero, and Rosa, for welcoming me into their family circle
during my stays in San Miguel. They fed me, housed me, encouraged me, and
taught me how to behave, with endless kindness and affection (not to mention
the excellect cooking).
Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank all the people of San Miguel
Chimalapa. They made me welcome in their community in every way, which I
sometimes failed to appreciate at the time, but will never forget. They held the
bus for me in Juchitán, they guided me, they explained customs and traditions,
and they shared their own histories with me. I wish I could offer them more
than a grammar, and I hope that someday this work will help someone
remember what a truly fine and wondrous thing it is to be a Zoque of San
Miguel Chimalapa.
