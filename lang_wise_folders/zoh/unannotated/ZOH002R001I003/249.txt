Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
There are a few cases in which V1 seems to serve as the patient of V2.
While the first example (8.31) could be analyzed as 'she spoke, lying' or 'she
lied while speaking', the other examples don't conform nicely to the 'V2 by V1-
ing' template. It doesn't make sense to interpret (ii), for instance, as 'it lost its
color by being painted.'

Another common function of compound verb constructions is to describe
compactly two actions that are performed or occur simultaneously. The
compounds with directional verbs and a common actor described above fall into
this group, but they can be composed of other sorts of roots as well.
