Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
RRG employs the useful notion of semantic macroroles for the description
of the argument structure of verbs (Dowty, 1979; Van Valin and LaPolla,
1997:141 ff). Cross-linguistically, subjects of verbs tend to be selected from a
restricted set of possible semantic roles: agent, experiencer, instrument,
recipient, source, and force. Objects are similarly restricted to a small set of
roles: patient, theme, recipient, source and location. These sets can be
generalized under the headings actor and undergoer, respectively, greatly
simplifying discussions of sets of predicates with essentially similar argument
structures, but slight differences in the precise role played by the most
prominent arguments2. In MIG Zoque, the sets are actually more restricted,
since only animate or quasi-animate entities (like the wind) can be actors.
English sentences with non-animate actors, such as 'the rock hit the wall' or
'the knife cut the bread' would have to be paraphrased along the lines of
'(someone) threw the rock at the wall' or 'the bread was cut with a knife'3. This
restriction is similar to that described for Jacaltec Mayan by Craig (1977).
2 There appears to be a sort of thematic hierarchy operating in MIG Zoque, in that the texts
show a strong preference for volitional (human) entities as subjects, either as actors or agents,
and for inanimate entities as patients. I did not study this systematically, and so have none of
the negative evidence that is necessary to fully demonstrate the idea.
3 Expressions of this kind are acceptable in MAR Zoque (Kaufman, p.c.).
