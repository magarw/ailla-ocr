SVO order is the most frequent in this category, with 61.1% of transitive
clauses with both subject and object NPs appearing in this order. It is
reasonable to suppose that the preference for SV order when only subject NPs
appear and VO order when there is only an object NP is a reflection of this same
preferred pattern. Again, in many of these the subject NP is a pronoun, as
shown in (14.14 i). Example (ii) is the climax of 'The Two-Legged One', when
the little jaguar finally has his showdown with the hunter, who shoots him
fatally.

but they don't seem to appear in the texts. (I haven't made an exhaustive search for them.)
