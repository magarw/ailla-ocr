Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Operators are elements "which are qualitatively different from predicates
and their arguments" (Van Valin and LaPolla, 1997:40). These include clausal
elements such as tense, aspect, negatives, etc. These modify different layers of
the clauses in which they appear; thus, aspect is a nuclear operator, mood
(deontic modals expressing such notions as obligation) is a core operator, and
tense is a clausal operator. Operators may be affixes (e.g., the progressive
suffix -ing), function words (e.g., English auxiliary verbs), or content words
(e.g., adverbs like 'frankly' that affect the illocutionary force of a clause).
Clauses are combined into complex sentences by means of junctures at
the various levels: nuclear, core, and clause (including the periphery). Causative
constructions in English are an example of a nuclear juncture, as in "The woman
made the child eat." Although there are two predicates, 'make' and 'eat', they
function together as a single, complex predicate. Most verb stem compounds
in MIG Zoque are nuclear junctures. In the example below, ha?k- 'to drown' and
ka?- 'to die' are compounded inside the verb complex, forming a single
complex predicate.

Core junctures combine two cores, each with its own set of arguments.
An example from English (from Van Valin and La Polla, 1997:444) is "I ordered
Fred to force the door open." The two cores are 'I ORDER Fred' and 'Fred FORCE
the door open'. Some verb stem compounds in MIG Zoque are core junctures.
In example (2.5), the two cores are 'I HELP my mother' and 'my mother WASH
