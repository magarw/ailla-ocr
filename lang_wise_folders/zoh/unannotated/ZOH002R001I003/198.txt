7.2. Noun and adjective formation
This section describes the affixes that are used to form nouns and
adjectives from verb roots.
7.2.1. Participles and result nouns
There are two suffixes that form deverbal adjectives and nouns that have
a participial or resultative character. The definition is fuzzy because the
meanings of nouns formed with these suffixes varies, but all have the general
sense of 'the result of V-ing' or 'the condition of having been V-ed'.
Each has a set of phonological alternations. NOM2 labels the set [a, a?, ə,
and ǝ?], represented by A in the morpheme breakdown line of the examples.
NOM3 labels the set [e, e?, i, and i?], represented by E in the morpheme
breakdown line. The choice of vowel is governed by the vowel harmony process
discussed in section 3.3.2. Given the general preference of MIG Zoque for CVC
syllables, I think it is likely that originally there were only the glottal stop-final
alternants, but it is not possible to determine this conclusively given the
fragility of word-final glottal stops in this language.
NOM2 is much less abundantly attested than NOM3. I tried to elicit both
forms for every verb root in the lexicon, and found very few roots that would
accept NOM2, whereas nearly every root allows NOM3. There seems to be
interference from the imperative suffix, which has the same phonological
shapes as NOM2. NOM2 forms are more likely to be clearly nouns, while
NOM3 forms are more likely to be participle-like adjectives.
