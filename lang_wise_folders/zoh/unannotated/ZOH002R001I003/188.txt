7.1.1.10 yuk
yuk- has the clearly directional meaning 'up', and so it receives the gloss
symbol ARR. It also frequently means 'to begin', in which sense it can apply to
any verb root. It never appears with the suffix -?əy.

7.1.2. Positional suffixes
There are three positional suffixes in MIG Zoque: the assumptive, the
depositive, and the stative. When these appear with a verb root, they tend to
highlight deep, abstract, notions of shape and position that are inherent in the
meaning of the root, but less apparent when the root is used in an underived
stem. For example, the root hup-, when used without a positional suffix, is
translated as 'to pull': 7ǝy huppa, 'he pulled it'. With the assumptive suffix,
however, the abstract positional meaning of the root becomes apparent:
hupneyyə, 'it is stretched out'. There are many MIG Zoque verbs that entail
very particular notions of position or shape, of the hands, body, or other
