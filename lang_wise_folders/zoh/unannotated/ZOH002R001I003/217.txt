Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
limited in terms of acceptable combinations. These are discussed in section
8.2.
8.1. Auxiliary verb constructions
There are six auxiliaries in MIG Zoque, all intransitive roots of motion,
manner, or aspect:
(8.2)
(i)
(iii)
Motion
nək- 'ir'
min- 'venir'
tih- 'ir&regresar'
Aspect
Pokmaŋ- 'empezar'
(ii)
Manner
hə?kš- 'apurarse'
muš- 'saber'
An example of each one is given in (8.3). nək-, 'ir', and min-, 'venir',
are far and away the most commonly used. tih-, 'ir y regresar', is used when
the round-trip character of the motion is relevant. Both muš-, 'saber', and
?okmaŋ-, 'empezar', appear most commonly in verb root compound
constructions; in fact, I found no examples of ?okmaŋ- in the dependent verb
construction in the texts. hə?kš-, 'apurarse', is extremely rare in any form.
Relative frequency in the corpus notwithstanding, it is easy to elicit examples of
any of the auxiliaries, while other likely suspects¹ (such as tuk-, 'terminarse')
are roundly rejected.
