6.2. Agreement
Dixon (1979, 1994) defines three primitive argument relations: A, the
subject of transitive verbs; S, the subject of intransitive verbs; and O, the object
of transitive verbs. These terms are useful in describing the MIG Zoque verb
agreement system, in which transitive verbs are marked to agree with both
subject and object, and intransitive verbs are marked to agree with the subject.
In the overview in chapter 2, I characterized this language as ergative. Table
2.1 shows the pronominal agreement markers that cross-reference the A, S,
and O relations.

The third person system is prototypically ergative: S and O are the
unmarked absolutive case, and A is specially marked as ergative. The first
person system is almost as purely ergative, in that A is distinctively marked as
ergative and the S and O relations are referenced by the same absolutive
marker, except in the case where A references a second person actor who is
acting on a first person undergoer. Here the ambiguous morpheme miš is
