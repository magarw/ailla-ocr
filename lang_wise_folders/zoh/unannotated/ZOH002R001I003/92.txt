'that', but the temporal form is generally glossed ahora, 'now', rather than
entonces, 'then'. Distal ga- (DCT3) deictics are distant from both the speaker
and the hearer and may in fact not be visible at all. These are glossed with the
Spanish distal, aquel/aquella, 'that'.
A concrete description may help to clarify the system. Sr. Sánchez and I
were sitting at a table in the patio, in adjacent chairs. To refer to his chair, or a
hat sitting right in front of him (which he touched as he spoke), he used DCT1.
To refer to a hat hanging on the back of a chair on the opposite side of the
table (no nearer to me than to him), or a shrub near our table, he used DCT2.
To refer to a shrub near the wall surrounding the patio, or the street outside the
garden wall (not visible to us) he used DCT3.
