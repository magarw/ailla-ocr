and the kinds of roles that are required by different verb classes is discussed in
chapter 6. Adjectives (section 4.5) and intensifiers (section 4.9) appear in
modifying positions in noun and verb phrases, respectively. Postpositions
(section 4.7) are clitic forms that attach to the right edge of a noun phrase.
Adverbs (section 4.8) indicate time, direction, or location, but are separate
words that may appear in various places in the clause, which distinguishes
these forms from postpositions. Subordinators (section 4.10) and modals
(section 4.11) are function words with restrictions on their positions within the
verb phrase. Discourse markers (section 4.12) are not morphosyntactically
integral to the clauses in which they appear, serving instead to structure the
discourse as a whole.
4.1. Verbs
Verbs are unambiguously classifiable as those roots that must appear
with an aspect or mood suffix and an agreement marker. Verb roots may be
grossly subclassified as intransitive or transitive, according to which set of
pronominal agreement markers is used for the subject. Intransitive verbs
appear with absolutive subject markers, and transitive verbs appear with
ergative subject markers. Intransitive verbs are discussed in section 4.1.1.
Transitive verbs can be further divided into three sub-classes. These are
discussed in section 4.1.2.
Two smaller classes of verbs can also be defined by formal criteria:
positional verbs and affective verbs. The positional class consists of those verb
roots that can take the assumptive suffix -ney. These are discussed in section
4.1.3. Affective verbs, also known as sound symbolism verbs, take the
