Plurals are formed by means of the plural clitic +dəkkay (NPL), which
usually appears in one of it's reduced forms: +dək (usually phrase-medial) or
+dǝkka. The unreduced form appears most often in careful speech and at the
ends of phrases.

4.3. Pronouns
Pronouns and deictics overlap in the set of words that refer to the third
person. Since the third person roots participate in a wider system of suffixes
than the first and second person pronouns, I separate them into a distinct class,
which is discussed in detail in section 4.6. So, only the first and second person
forms are included in the pronoun class.
Pronouns accept the nominal plural clitic +haa?, which can also appear
with nouns that refer in some way to a group of people (like the word
kumkuyhaa?, 'townspeople', in example 4.16 iii)¹. A table listing all of the first
and second person pronouns is shown below. First person plural pronouns are
divided into two sets: exclusive (X) forms refer to the speaker and some other
This clitic also has a quantifying function and is discussed further in section 9.5.
