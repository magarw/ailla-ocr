?entonses is also frequently used to begin a story. Although it is always
translated ya 'now' in Spanish, a more apt translation in English would be 'once
upon a time'.

14.13.2. Discourse markers in dialog
The next set of markers appears only in dialogs. hə?, 'yes', and nə?tti,
'no', signal agreement and disagreement, respectively. Since they always
appear at the beginning of an utterance, they also serve to signal a change of
speaker. In (14.26 i), the lieutenant has just tried to give Satornino a rifle to
shoot the monkeys with. Example (ii) uses bweno to mark a change of speaker
and simultaneously signal agreement or approval of the situation in general.
Here, the lieutenant has just finished his lengthy speech to the mayor, in which
he rather pompously sings Satornino's praises.
