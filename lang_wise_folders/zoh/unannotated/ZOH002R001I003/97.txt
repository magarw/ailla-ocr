Table 4.5: Root morphemes of spatial adverbs and postpositions
Paŋ, həš-, and win- also appear as verbal prefixes, whence their gloss
codes 3. These three forms appeared as independent words at an earlier stage
of the language (Kaufman, p.c.; see section 7.1.1 for more discussion). Because
of this historical independence and because of the clear relatedness amongst
the forms, I'm inclined to class all of the lexemes based on these morphemes as
adverbs, rather than postpositions, whether I have direct evidence of their
current independent status or not. However, there is a small subset of the ?aŋ-
forms (Paŋji?, ?aŋhə?, ?aŋhənaŋ, and ?aŋhəəŋ) that consistently behave like
postpositions, in that they only appear immediately after the noun phrase to
which they pertain, and they often seem to affect the stress of the preceding
noun, which an independent lexeme would not do. For example, in the phrase
huštiš?aŋhi?, 'at the mayor's office', as it appears in ZOH001 R011-003, the
primary stress falls on ?aŋ-, and only a very weak secondary stress falls on the
This kə- is not the same as the verbal prefix kə-, AWAY. Historically, this one is kə?,
roughly meaning 'lower part' (Wichman, 1995).
