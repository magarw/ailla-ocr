Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
unsuccessful, although it is a plausible candidate for the auxiliary set, since
other Zoquean languages have a 'walk' auxiliary (Himes, 1997).
In this construction, the auxiliary follows the main verb. The main verb is
directly inflected for aspect, while the auxiliary bears the dependent suffix. The
main verb is marked for agreement with whichever set of markers is
appropriate, absolutive or ergative, and an ergative marker appears between
the two. The syntax follows this template:
<Agreement marker> <V1-Infl> <Ergative marker>

Verbs in this construction have a clearly continuative aspectual force,
whether they are in the incompletive or the completive. This construction
means 'to go/come/walk around doing V1'. The meaning of nək-, 'ir', is
somewhat bleached semantically, as can be seen in examples (8.11 i) and (ii).
In (i), the little jaguar doesn't actually go anywhere until after he grows up. The
semantic force of wit-, 'andar', is very evident, however; it only appears in this
construction when the V1 event is something that can be done while walking
around (iii-iv). The clear literalness of the motion of the action in these
constructions perhaps explains why tih-, 'ir y regresar', doesn't appear in them:
