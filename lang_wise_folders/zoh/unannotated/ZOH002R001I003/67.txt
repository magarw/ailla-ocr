Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
the glides /y/ and /w/ are deleted intervocalically, thus producing a vowel
sequence. Basically, when a morpheme whose coda consists of a glide is
suffixed by a vowel-initial morpheme, and the two vowels meet the
requirements discussed here shortly, the glide will be deleted. The set of vowel
initial morphemes is given in section 3.3.2. In these cases, the two vowels do
not then contract according to the rule discussed in 3.3.8, which applies to
vowels that are identical (after assimilation applies).
There are two separate rules. /y/ is deleted when it appears in coda
position either before or after a front vowel. (The front vowels are /i/ and /e/.)
The one exception is that it is not deleted between two /e/s. (I only have one
example of this exception, shown in 3.16 vi.) The productive rule is thus:
y --> 0 / [/i/, /u/, /o/, /ə/, /a/]
