The existential relative clause construction is always employed when
modifying a noun with a deverbal adjective derived with the NOM3 suffix, -E
(and less frequently, the NOM2 suffix, -A). The relative marker is required for
these forms whether they appear before or after the noun. Note that the stress
in the second example of each of the pairs shown below is on the final syllable
of the relative clause, as expected, since a vowel has been contracted (section
3.3.8). Stress falls on the first syllable in the first example of each pair,
possibly because there is some aesthetic constraint preventing two primary
stresses from occurring right next to each other. Nouns typically have only one
or two syllables, unless they are formed from complex verb stems.
