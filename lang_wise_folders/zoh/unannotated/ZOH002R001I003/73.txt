reduplicative suffix -ney. They are discussed in section 4.1.4. Apart from these
definitional restrictions, any verbal affix may appear with any verb.
Auxiliary verbs are a small class of verbs with unique syntactic properties.
The set of auxiliaries and the grounds for determining membership in this set
are discussed in section 4.1.5. The inflectional morphology of auxiliary verb
phrases is discussed in section 5.6. The syntactic properties of auxiliary verb
phrases are discussed in chapter 8.
4.1.1 Intransitive verbs
Intransitive verb roots appear with absolutive person agreement markers.
In the lexicon, these roots are further divided into two groups: 11, or unergative
verbs, in which the subject is the actor or agent of the verbal event; and 12, or
unaccusative verbs, in which the subject is the patient or theme of the verbal
event (Perlmutter & Postal, 1984). There are no formal criteria for
distinguishing the two subclasses; the division was made based on the
understanding of Kaufman and myself of the meanings of these roots. The
label Ix was used for roots that we were unable to classify as either 11 or 12.
Most verbs of speaking fall into the 11 class, as well as the verbs of motion. The
distinction made in the lexicon is an artifact of the research process. Since we
were unable to find any formal criteria for subdividing the class of intransitive
verbs, the distinction is not carried into this grammar.
