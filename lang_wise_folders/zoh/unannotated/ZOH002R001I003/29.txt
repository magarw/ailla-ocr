Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
information as we could produce for each item: morphological analysis,
historical attributes of underlying forms, usage and grammatical codes,
examples, principal derived forms, and much cross-referencing with root forms
and derived expressions.
During my year in the field, I taped some 15 hours of narrative texts with
ten different speakers, both men and women. These texts were transcribed by
me, usually with Sr. Sánchez, but occasionally with the narrator, and then
translated into Spanish by Sr. Sánchez. English translations were produced by
me from the Zoque texts. They are all entered into Shoebox databases and
most have been analyzed using Shoebox's interlinearization tools. In addition
to these natural texts, there are several small databases of elicited sentences,
which I constructed and then tested with Sr. Sánchez and Sr. Camilo Miguel
Sánchez. The texts, the elicited examples, and the lexicon, all comprise the
data on which this grammar is based, and are collectively referred to
henceforward as the corpus.
1.3. Methodology
The foundation of this grammar are the natural texts in the corpus. The
dictionary work, supplemented by discussions with Kaufman and others on the
project and intensive training by Sr. Sánchez, gave me an initial grasp of the
MIG Zoque language. During the months of taping, transcribing, translating,
and interlinearizing texts, the principal grammatical patterns of the language
emerged. Since the texts tended to be quite similar in style, usage, and lexical
range, I began constructing sentences based on those found in the texts that
would test the full range of syntactic and morphological possibilities. As the
