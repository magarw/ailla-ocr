The voiceless alveolar affricate /c/ (the sound at the beginning of the
word 'tsunami', functions as part of the natural class of voiceless consonants,
with respect to syllable structure (section 3.2.2).
Voiced consonants appear (a) at the beginning of pronouns, deictics, and
a few other function words, and (b) word-internally after the operation of a
voicing rule. The affricate /č/ occurs as the result of a morphophonological
process (section 3.3.6) and in some loan words. The fricatives /s/ and /f/ and
the liquids // and /r/ appear in only a few odd words of unknown origin,
affective (sound symbolism) verbs (section 4.1.4), and Spanish loan words.
/ə/ in MIG Zoque is a mid back unrounded vowel. In the other MZ
languages, including MAR Zoque, the "sixth vowel" is typically a high back
unrounded vowel, /ü/. Lengthened vowels may result from syllable shape or
from syllable deletion (section 3.3.9), but there is no underlying phonemic
contrast in vowel length.
