The orthography used in the lexicons is different from that employed in
this grammar. We used an ASCII-compatible orthography to simplify data entry
and to provide the speaker communities with orthographies that can be used
on typewriters as well. The table below shows the symbols used for the non-
ASCII characters in the MALDP orthography, the IPA, and the standard
orthography for Zoque languages.
@ represents the 'sixth vowel' in the lexical databases. This is a high mid
vowel in the other MZ languages, but a mid mid vowel in MIG Zoque. So,
although I use for this vowel in the grammar, it will appear as ü in the pretty-
printed lexical entries retrieved by the search.

morpheme breaks are indicated by the appropriate morpheme break symbol.

essentially the morpheme breakdown of the word. The character ' is used to
