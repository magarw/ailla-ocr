Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chapter 1: Introduction
San Miguel Chimalapa is a town of about 5,000 people in southwestern
Oaxaca, Mexico. Most of the residents of the town are Zoques, although there
are also Zapotecs and non-indigenous Mexicans living there. Outlying
communities that belong to the San Miguel municipio are more likely to be
non-Zoque the farther down the mountain they lie. Going up the mountain,
there are tiny hamlets of Zoques speaking the San Miguel dialect (hereafter, MIG
Zoque), until one passes Cofradía, after which one enters the Santa María
Chimalapa (MAR Zoque) municipio. These two dialects are mutually intelligible,
though quite different in many ways (Kaufman, 1996).
Estimates of numbers of speakers are rough, and tend to conflate the two
Chimalapan communities. There were around 2,000 speakers of MIG Zoque in
1990 (Grimes, 1992) and another 3-4,000 speakers of MAR Zoque. There are
no active speakers of MIG Zoque under the age of 40, although there are many
between the ages of 20 and 40 who understand the language. There are now
two generations of Zoques in San Miguel who have not acquired the Zoque
language as their first. Everyone in this community speaks Spanish.
The Chimalapas are a high wilderness area on the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec. A large tract of this region is officially Zoque territory (Rojas,
1994), although recent years have seen incursions by Tzeltals and Tzotzíls from
Chiapas. The area was accessible only on foot until the early 1960's, when
roads were built to the two municipios, and schools, clinics, electricity, and
outsiders arrived. The principal market city of the region is Juchitán, a Zapotec
city, and the lowlands around the southern rim of the Chimalapas are
