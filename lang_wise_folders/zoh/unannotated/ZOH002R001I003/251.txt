8.3.5. V1 Object is V2 Subject
In most of the examples that have been discussed so far, V1 and V2 have
been nuclear junctures; that is, they are linked in the nucleus of the clause and
thus share precisely the same arguments. In (8.34 ii) above, both the jaguar
and the man turn and they both stand facing each other - they are the mutual
actors of the clause. MIG Zoque compound verb constructions also allow core
junctures in which "two cores, each with their own nucleus and corresponding
arguments, are joined together to form a larger complex core" (Foley & Olson,
1985:47).
The two cores are constrained to share an argument, which Foley & Olson
claim must be either the actor or the undergoer. A common form of core
juncture in Zoque is one in which the undergoer of a transitive V1 is the
undergoer of an intransitive V2, as shown in the examples in (8.35). Foley &
