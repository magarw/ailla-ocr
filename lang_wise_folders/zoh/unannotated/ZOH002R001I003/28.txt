Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
1.2. The data
The data used in the present study was collected in the field in the
summers of 1994 and 1995, under the auspices of MALDP, and during the
1995-1996 academic year, during which time I resided in Oaxaca with aid of
grants from the Fulbright Commission and the National Science Foundation. I
made one follow-up visit of two weeks during the summer of 1998.
My principal consultant throughout this time has been Germán Sánchez
Morales, a native speaker of Zoque from San Miguel. He is in his mid-fifties,
and although he does not read or write, is a gifted narrator and language
teacher. He spent many years of his youth on a ranchería (a very tiny hamlet)
with his grandmother, and thus speaks a more conservative variety of MIG
Zoque than many of his peers. He began to learn Spanish at the age of twelve,
when he moved back to San Miguel. All of the data used in this work, even that
which originated with other consultants, was reviewed with Sr. Sánchez. Most
of the translations into Spanish of text and lexical items are also his.
The lexicon is based initially on tapes containing about 2000 lexical items
that were made in San Miguel in 1994 by two assistants of Terrence Kaufman,
Benigno Robles Reyes and Ester Martinez Sánchez, and two Zoque consultants,
Gelasio Sánchez Morales and Camilo Miguel Sánchez. These tapes were
transcribed by Kaufman. I extended the lexicon during the summers of 1994
and 1995 with Sr. Sánchez. The lexicon was reviewed in its entirety by Kaufman
and Sr. Sánchez during the summer of 1995, and partially reviewed again by
those two the following summer. It now consists of around 4,000 entries, with
translations in both Spanish and English. Lexical entries contain as much
