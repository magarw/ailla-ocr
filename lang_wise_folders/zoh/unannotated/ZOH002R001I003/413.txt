indicate a glottal stop that gets deleted or that induces gemination of the
preceding consonant, as is the case with the initial glottal stop of the
antipassive suffix 7oy.
Similarly, W is used to indicate a /w/ that induces gemination in the
preceding syllable. Such a W is found in the entry for ?aŋmayyə?k, 'student':
7anh-may-W@+V7k (MOUTH.count.COM+REL). Another symbol intended to
provide information about historical connections among these languages is H,
which indicates a glottal fricative that does not appear on the surface in some
languages. These H's never appear on the surface in MIG Zoque, which is why I
don't use them in the morpheme breakdown lines in my examples. An entry
with this symbol is 7anh-kuk.'aH (?aŋkukka-, 'to collec
These orthographic conventions are used in all the fields that represent
the underlying form of the entry: lex, PHO, UND, VAR, and EXU (an example of
the entry's use).
The next field that might of interest as a search term is GRAM, used for a
grammatical code describing the entry. Some of these codes are shown in table
A.3. The codes are based on Spanish words, and may be combined into strings
reflecting the components of the lexical entry. For example, the code sms
indicates a noun (sustantivo) modifying another noun. This is not a constrained
set of items, and thus would be difficult to exploit in a fine-tuned search, but
one could use it to find all the transitive verbs, for example.
