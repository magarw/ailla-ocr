Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
1.4. Presentation of data
Most of the supporting data in this book is presented in four lines, as
shown in the example below.
(1.1)
dey 7øn tzampa tum 'istorya
de.y
'øn+ tzam-pa tum 'istorya
DCT2.TMP 1E+ platicar-INC uno historia
'Ya les voy a platicar una historia.'
(ZOH001 R006-001)
The first line is a direct transcription of the expression that shows any
elisions or contractions that were pronounced, using the standard orthography
for MixeZoquean languages (see Appendix G). The second line is a morphemic
representation of the first, in which underlying forms are given for each
morpheme. The third line provides glosses for each morpheme. (A complete
list of morpheme glosses is given on page iv.) The fourth line is a free
translation of the expression. Exceptions occur when the example consists of a
single morpheme, in which case the breakdown line would be superfluous.
Most of the examples were drawn from texts, not elicited specifically to
illustrate grammatical points. The part of the example that corresponds to the
topic under discussion will be written in bold-face type as an aid to the reader.
So, if example (1.1) were part of the discussion of time deictics, the first word,
dey 'now', would have been bold-faced.
The following symbols are used to separate morphemes. When a bound
morpheme is mentioned in the text, it is preceded or followed by the
appropriate symbol. Verb roots are conventionally indicated with a following
hyphen, although they can take affixes on either side; for example, nøk- 'to
walk.'
