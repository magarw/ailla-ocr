Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
(examples iii-iv) might have been deleted at some earlier stage of the language.
Note that in the (iii) and (iv), the 'front' vowel that supplies the appropriate
context is /ə/. This is further evidence for the fact that this vowel functions in
the MIG Zoque system as its correlate /ü/ does in the other MZ languages. The
second vowel in these words is always strongly laryngealized.

/w/ is deleted between an /o/ and an /e/ or an /a/. A syllable-final /w/
will normally appear on the surface as /n/ (section 3.3.3). But when the /w/-
final morpheme is followed by a vowel-initial suffix, the resulting stem is re-
syllabified with /w/ as the onset of the added syllable. So, it ends up between
the two vowels. The rule is this:
/W/ --> 0 / /0/3

have no examples with a /u/ next to a /w/. It seems to be a strongly disfavored
conjunction of sounds.
