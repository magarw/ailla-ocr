My consultant preferred the first translation given for each of the
examples above; that is, it was the woman who fell down and the boy who ran
away. He said that it was logical: if you hit someone, they're more likely to fall
than you are, and a boy who kisses a girl is liable to be so embarassed by his
act that he runs away. He also accepted the opposite interpretation for both
sentences the man falling and the girl running away but thought that
although they were acceptable as sentences, they were less plausible as events.
In English, the syntax admits only one interpretation of such sentences:
the elided subject of the second clause must refer to the same entity as the
subject of the preceding clause. It must be the man who falls and the boy who
runs away. The subject is the syntactic pivot. the "syntactic argument [that]
bears the privileged grammatical function in the construction" (Van Valin & La
Polla, 1997:275). In MIG Zoque, it is neither the syntactic subject nor the
semantic role (in both the examples, agent) that controls the interpretation of
the second clause, but the pragmatics of the situation; thus, MIG Zoque can be
said to have a pragmatic pivot.
Another general feature of subordinate clauses in MIG Zoque is the
importation of Spanish subordinators expressing the relation of the subordinate
clause to the superordinate one. There are three native subordinators: the
relative clause clitic +V?k, the purpose clause marker goo?, and the 'if' clause
marker bi?t. Other kinds of clauses are introduced by Spanish loan words, such
as lonke, aunque, 'although', and kom kwando, como cuando, 'as if'. The native
subordinators co-exist in ordinary discourse with their Spanish counterparts:
que, 'that', para, 'in order to', and si, 'if'. (Actually, para and si appear more
frequently in the corpus than goo? and bi?t.) Over the course of a single
narrative produced by a single speaker, we find examples of both the MIG
