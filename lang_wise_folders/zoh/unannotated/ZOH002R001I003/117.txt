Table 5.1. Pronouns and person agreement markers.
In the second column Absolutive (transitive object) the first and
second person forms are followed by an indication of which grammatical person
is acting on the object. For example, if a third person agent is acting on a
second person patient, the agreement marker is mi (3>2). If a first or second
person agent is acting on a second or first person patient, respectively, the
agreement marker will be miš (1>2; 2>1). A more detailed discussion of
agreement marking is given in chapter 6. Examples that clarify this compact
notation are given in the paradigms in examples 5.1 and 5.2.
