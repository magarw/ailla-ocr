Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimapala Zoque
Chapter 5: Inflectional Morphology
Obligatory inflection consists of a person agreement marker (5.1) and a
mood or aspect suffix (5.2). Optional inflectional morphology consists of
reciprocals (5.3), reflexives (5.4), negation (5.5), and marking of verbs as
dependent in auxiliary constructions (5.6).
5.1. Person agreement markers
Table 5.1 shows the set of person agreement markers. There are three
person categories in common use in the modern language: first, second, and
third. Historically, there were two first person categories: exclusive (X), which
referred to the speaker and hearer, but not everyone present, and inclusive (1),
which included to all persons present. The markers for these categories are
included in the table, but they occur very rarely in the corpus and were never
offered in elicitation sessions.
MIG Zoque, like the other MZ languages, is ergative: subjects of
intransitive verbs (S) and objects of transitive verbs (O) are marked with
Absolutive case, while subjects of transitive verbs (A) and possessors of nouns
are marked with Ergative case (Dixon, 1994). This is superficially a mixed
system. The first and third person markers are prototypically ergative, with
identity of forms for S and O and distinct forms for A. The second person
markers show an accusative pattern: S and A are the same, while there are
various ways to mark O, depending on the person of the agent. The merging of
second person forms is a relatively recent innovation in MIG Zoque (Kaufman,
p.c.).
