The next five words in table 14.8 are used to sequence sections of
narrative. They are more or less interchangeable, and the choice seems to be a
matter of personal taste. All speakers use Pentonses, 'then', which is the most
frequent choice from this set. Sr. Omobono Sánchez Miguel is the only speaker
who regularly uses gahiin, 'thence' (literally 'from there', DCT3.DIR2). All the
speakers use de gahi?, 'thence' (also literally 'from there', and a calque on the
Spanish de ahí). Most speakers use ?adyo, 'later', but mas cuhiam ('more
night.LOC1.NOM1.YA') appears only once, in Sr. Sánchez Miguel's 'The
Appearance of Santa Juanita', and I believe it was prompted by his desire to
speak the purest Zoque for the tape recorder and the alert ears of Sr. Sánchez
Morales.
These markers appear only at the beginnings of clauses, whereas dey and
gay always appear closer to the verbs they modify; that is, inside locatives or
11 Sr. Camilo Miguel Sánchez is the only speaker that uses this construction: tehi ke V, 'have to
V'. I believe it is a consequence of the fact that he is translating from a Spanish story as he
speaks.
