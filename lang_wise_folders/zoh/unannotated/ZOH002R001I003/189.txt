objects, and it is often the positional suffixes that make these meanings
apparent. (see chapter 13 for more discussion).
7.1.2.1. Assumptive ney
This suffix is diagnostic of the Positional verb root class. Verbs with the
assumptive suffix appear with absolutive agreement markers, indicating that
they are intransitive. Assumptive means "to assume the shape or orientation of
V-ing" (Kaufman, 1996). This generally translates as "to be in the position of
having been V-ed". These are not always transparently positional to our
sensibilities, as the first example shown below illustrates.
The suffix may also highlight an underlying, or nearly buried, sense of
positionality that is not the focus of the active verb root. In example (v), the
root nak≈°- generally means 'to hit or pound with a stick'. It's often included in
verb compounds (chapter 8) to supply a wooden instrument to the event
described by the other verb root. In this example, however, the visual character
of sticks is referenced: that they have branches that things can hang on. The
assumptive suffix may also focus on the act that produces the result that is
generally the focus of the root. In example (vi), below, the verb root koh-
usually means 'to pierce or punch a hole in something'. With the assumptive
suffix, the focus is on the position of the piercing instrument in the act of
piercing: the stick is stuck through the fruit.
