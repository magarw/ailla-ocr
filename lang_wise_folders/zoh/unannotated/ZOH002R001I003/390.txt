The next most frequent type of transitive clause has no overt NPs (21.4%).
Once a discourse entity is known, it doesn't need to be repeated explicitly
unless some other object intervenes. Also, in dialog, first and second person
entities are unambiguously referenced by the pronominal agreement markers
on the verb, so independent pronouns are not necessary. The examples in
(14.9) are taken from 'The Two-Legged One'. The little jaguar meets a bird (a
two-legged creature) on line 063, and converses with it. The bird NP appears
again in line 067, in one of the few explicit mentions of a dative argument
found in these texts. They continue to talk, and no other entities appear on the
scene, so that the transitive clauses without overt object NPs in lines 075 and
076 are unambiguous. This section of the tale is closed with a final mention of
the bird NP in line 078. The fact that this explicit mention is unnecessary for
interpretation suggests that it has an aesthetic purpose, that of
ng the
conclusion of an episode within the story.
