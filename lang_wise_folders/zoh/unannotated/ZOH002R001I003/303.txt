The examples in (11.13) were
interpretations for conjoined clauses in which the second clause lacks a specific
NP indicating the agent. If both the agent and patient (or recipient) of the first
conjunct are human and thus equally capable of filling either role, which will be
construed as the agent of the second conjunct? The determination is made
pragmatically, not syntactically. In the first example, it's the woman who burns
the letter, because (as it was explained to me) if the man wrote it, he sent it,
and once he'd sent it, he couldn't very well burn it. In the second example, it's
the mayor who reads the letter, because he's the one who sent for it. In the
fourth example, it could be the man who falls down, but it's more sensible that
it be the woman. In the fifth example, it could similarly be the woman who
leaves, but the favored interpretation is always that the man leaves. There is a
clear preference for the agent of the first conjunct also being considered the
agent of the second, although this is not strictly required.
