We can see in the transitive constructions shown above that marking of
the object is not transparent on the surface. The absolutive third person
marker is 0, and thus not evident when any subject acts on a third person
object (1>3, 2>3 and 3>3). We might expect to see both markers whenever
the object is first or second person. This is exactly what we get when the
subject is also a first or second person in MAR Zoque, Chiapas Zoque, and
proto-Mixe-Zoque (Kaufman, 1996). But in MIG Zoque we have an innovation,
the morpheme miš, which applies to both 1>2 and 2>1 situations.
6.2.1. The ambiguity of miš
miš is potentially ambiguous, and my consultants consistently rephrased
my examples using this morpheme in elicitation sessions. They seemed to
prefer the 2>1 reading where there was no disambiguating pronoun, but
generally preferred to specify the actor argument with either the first or second
person pronoun. The marker appears in texts without disambiguating
pronouns and caused no conflicts in translation; presumably, the rich context
of a narrative resolves the ambiguity completely, while the bare sentences that
we worked with in elicitation sessions tended to highlight it.
