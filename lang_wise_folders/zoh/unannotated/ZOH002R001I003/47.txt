Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Many Spanish function words have been borrowed, most notably the
conjunctions y, 'and', o, 'or', and pero, 'but'. Discourse markers like entonces,
'then', and de ahí, 'from there' have been borrowed, as have words for times
and places that apparently were not part of the pre-Hispanic culture, like ?ora,
hora, 'hour', and parke, parque, 'park'. Where there is a Zoque word, it tends to
be preferred. I seldom see the word mañana, 'morning', in place of ?aŋnamcu?,
for example.
So far we have a case of category (2) borrowing: phonology and
morphology restricted to the loan words with which they are associated, and
function words that had no native equivalents. Category (3) borrowing includes
adpositions and a more extensive set of function words. The Spanish
prepositions de, 'of' and para, 'for', appear in MIG Zoque sentences, preceding
the nouns in accordance with Spanish syntax, as shown in example (2.8). The
Zoque way to say this would employ the applicative suffix -hay to reference the
recipient.
