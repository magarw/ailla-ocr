Table 4.6. Non-spatial postpositions.
+goo? (BNF) and +pi?t (INSTR) are historically the same morphemes as
the subordinators goo? (PURP) and pi?t (IF) (Kaufman, p.c.). I have split them
into two separate classes because their syntactic behavior is different in MIG
Zoque. Postpositions mark the function of a non-argument noun phrase;
subordinators mark the relation of a subordinate clause to a superordinate
clause. The benefactive postposition is only used in the '(good) for a headache'
sense shown in example (4.27 i), never in the 'on behalf of a person' sense. The
Spanish loan word para is always used to convey the latter meaning, as shown
in example (v). Actually,+pi?t and +goo? in the postposition forms are rarely
used in the corpus. +goo? appears only in the text about traditional healing
practices (ZOH001R036, an interview with Sr. Omobono Sánchez Miguel) and
there are many other ways to express the instrument relation, including the use
of +hənaŋ.
