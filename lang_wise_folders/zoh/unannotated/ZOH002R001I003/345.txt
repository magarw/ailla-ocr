13.1.2. Perfect
There are two forms of the perfect in MIG Zoque, one negative and one
positive. The negative form is discussed below. The positive perfect is formed
by adding the clitic +7am (YA) to a verb complex with completive aspect.
Expressions in this form are generally translated with morphological accuracy
as 'now' with the Spanish preterite tense; for example, (13.4) was translated
'Román, well, now he died.'

However, an examination of the uses of this construction in texts reveals
that it clearly meets the definitional criteria for the perfect given in Smith
(1991:146): "(a) the situation precedes reference time; (b) the construction has
a resultant stative viewpoint; and (c) a special property is ascribed to the
subject, due to participation in the situation." Perfects, in general, really
perform two functions in a tense/aspect system: they situate an event in the
past, thus ordering the event temporally, and they present a state, which tends
to be the result of the past event (Smith, p.c.). Perfectives in MIG Zoque
