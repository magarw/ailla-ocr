Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Three of the most common ones are included in the table. Zoque
subordinators appear at the right edge of the verbal complex5; Spanish ones, in
accordance with the rules of Spanish grammar, appear at the left edge of the
subordinate clause. The Zoque forms go? and bi?t appear much less frequently
than their Spanish equivalents, para and si; when they do occur, they are often
paralleled by the Spanish term at the beginning of the clause (examples iii and
iv).

go? and bi?t show a tiny degree of flexibility with respect to position, as shown in
examples (4.31 i and ii). See chapter 11 for further discussion of this variability.
