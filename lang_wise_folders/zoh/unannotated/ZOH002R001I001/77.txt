4.1.3. Positional verbs
Positional verb roots are those that can take the assumptive suffix -ney.
Roots in this class are typically T3 transitives, although there are a few
intransitives. Positional roots express very abstract notions of shape, position,
or spatial extension, such as 'wrapped around and around' or 'stretched out'.
The range of meanings expressed by MIG Zoque positional roots is similar to
that described for the Mayan language Mam (England, 1983).
