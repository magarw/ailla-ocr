When a verb compound construction is negated, it is the action denoted
by V2 that is negated, not that denoted by V1. In example (8.19 i), Roberto
comes but doesn't bring the paper. In (ii), my mother washed the clothes, but
without my help. The translations for the rest of the examples clarify which
part of the complex action is negated.
