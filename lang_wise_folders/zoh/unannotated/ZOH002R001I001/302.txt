(11.12)
(i)
Duplicate arguments may be omitted from the conjoined clause. The
examples in 11.12 show constructions in which patient arguments are omitted
from the second conjunct. Example (iii), in which the antipassive is used in the
second conjunct to supress the patient, was not considered as felicitous as (ii),
in which the patient was simply omitted. Both sentences are grammatical - my
consultants just said that the version without the antipassive sounded better.
This could be because the antipassive is normally used to express general
actions, like cooking or doing some mending, rather than to supress reference
to a specific object that is known in the discourse context.
