Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
affixes are determined by stylistic or discourse considerations, as described for
Kuna in Sherzer (1989). Where possible, the first few examples given here for
each prefix will illustrate the directional sense of the morpheme and the rest of
the examples will cover the range of meanings contributed.
The syntax of these prefixes is simple. None of them exhibits a
preference for verbs of any particular class. With the exception of ko-, SOC,
discussed in 7.1.1.5., none of them has any predictable effect on the argument
structure of the verbal complex. Sometimes adding the prefix to an intransitive
root results in a transitive verb, but this is not a regular characteristic of any of
these morphemes. Many of the prefixes co-occur with the suffix -?ay (section
7.1.4), whose meaning and function are unknown. The frequency of such co-
occurrence is noted for each prefix.
Three of the prefixes - ?aŋ-, MOUTH; həš-, BACK; and win-, FACE – are
historically nominal prepounds. They do not appear as independent words in
the modern language, but do appear in a few compounds with other nouns and
as directional adverbs, in frozen forms with postpositions attached. For the
most part, however, they pattern with the directional prefixes, appearing most
frequently as affixes on verbs. The first examples given for these three
prefixes will demonstrate their semi-nominal status; the remainder will exhibit
their behavior as affixes.
We'll look at each prefix in the subsections that follow, in alphabetical
order. Unless otherwise noted, the examples in this section come from the
lexicon. Some of these were elicited by running most of the verb roots in the
language through a grid of the prefixes. Many of the words discovered in this
