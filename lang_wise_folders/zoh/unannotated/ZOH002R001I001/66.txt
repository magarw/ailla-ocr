3.3.9. Syllable deletion
The final vowel of short words is optionally deleted in compounds or
incorporation constructions. This happens most often with adjectives, which
tend to have the shape CVCV(?). (A final glottal stop is deleted by the normal
process.) In these cases, the initial vowel retains the length of a vowel in a
stressed, open syllable, even though one might expect the word to be re-
syllabified, taking the onset of the deleted syllable for the coda of the
remaining one, and thus shortening the vowel to the normal closed-syllable
length.
I will mark these long vowels in the example data with a following ':' to
make it easier to read the transcriptions as they are pronounced, and as a
reminder that a syllable has been omitted. The same convention applies to
entries and example sentences in the lexicon. This lengthening is not,
however, in any way contrastive, and there are no prefixes or verb roots that
might be confused with these shortened adjectives.

3.3.10. Glide deletion
There are no underlying sequences of vowels in MIG Zoque (nor in any of
the Mixe-Zoquean languages generally.) However, under certain circumstances
