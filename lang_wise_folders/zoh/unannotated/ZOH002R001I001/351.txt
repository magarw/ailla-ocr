In many of the texts in the corpus, the narrator is describing his or her
work or daily life. Since these are descriptions of habitual activities, the
incompletive is used. The examples in (13.10) are taken from a text by Sra.
Teófila Sánchez Morales (Sr. Germán Sánchez Morales's sister), in which she
describes the typical work day of a Zoque housewife (which begins an hour
before dawn and continues until ten o'clock at night.)
