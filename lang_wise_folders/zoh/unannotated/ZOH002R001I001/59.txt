Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
There are a few lexemes that appear to be exceptions to these harmony
rules. Some of them look intriguingly like the result of a total harmony rule
that would have applied in an earlier stage of the language. There aren't very
many of these, indicating that this is not an ongoing process.

3.3.3. Alternation of /ŋ/ and /w/
/ŋ/ and /w/ appear in mutually exclusive contexts: there are no syllables
that begin with /ŋ/ and none that end with /w/. An underlying /w/ becomes
/ŋ/ at the end of a syllable. When one of the vowel-initial suffixes is attached
to a stem ending in /ŋ/, the underlying /w/ surfaces due to the re-
syllabification of the resulting word.
