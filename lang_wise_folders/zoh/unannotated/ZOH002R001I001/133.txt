Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chapter 6: The basic clause
In this chapter, I will discuss the structure of simple declarative clauses.
The clause type that occurs most frequently in MIG Zoque narratives is a single
verbal complex with no noun phrases. Core arguments are cross-referenced on
the verb and thus do not need to be explicitly mentioned in every utterance.
This is illustrated in the example below, in which the hero of the story, Román,
is mentioned in the first sentence, but not referenced by any noun phrase or
pronoun in the second two.
(6.1)
Rromán tungpøkkø. Nøkwø. Naxe, ye'tztzø gaji'.
rromán 0 tuŋ=pək-wə
0 nək-wǝ naše 0 ye?c-we ga.hi?
román 3A road-grab-COM 3A go-COM truth 3A arrive-COM DCT3.LOC1
'Román took to the road. He went. In fact, he arrived there.'

Although most of the data samples presented in this chapter will include
noun phrases referencing the core arguments for clarity of exposition, it should
be borne in mind that these could be omitted without loss of grammaticality or
coherence, given an appropriate context.
Section 6.1. describes the set of possible core arguments allowed by
verbs¹ in MIG Zoque and shows how core NPs are distinguished from non-core
NPs. Section 6.2 describes the agreement system, including the mapping of
pronominal agreement markers to arguments and possible referents of the
plural suffixes. This section includes a description of inverse alignment in MIG
Zoque. In section 6.3, I present the valency-changing suffixes (causative,
1 In this chapter, I use the term verb to denote both simple verb roots and verb stems, which
might include derivational affixes, compounded verb roots, and/or an incorporated noun. In
order to talk about arguments and agreements, I need to be able to refer to a nearly complete
verb complex, that includes everything except the agreement markers and inflectional affixes.
