Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
huti? 'which' selects from a set of possible alternatives. It
appears alone (example 12.4 i), but also appears with the clitic
+hate? (ii). This is a relative of the pluralizing clitic +haa? that was
discussed in section 9.5, which also has a set-selection
connotation³. This clitic only appears attached to the question
word huti? in MIG Zoque.

hucen 'how many' only appears a few times in the text
corpus, but its meaning and syntax are clear. It is simply used to
elicit a specific quantity. The idiom for asking the price of
something is shown in example (12.5 iii). Like the quantifiers
discussed in section 9.5, hucen can be made into a verb with the
versive suffix (iv). There is also the form huceti (possibly hucen=ti,
how_many=what) that can be used with a noun phrase to indicate
an unknown (questioned) quantity (v).
3 In MAR Zoque, +hate? means 'each'.
