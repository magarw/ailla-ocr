Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
4.12. Discourse markers
This class contains the words that are often labelled particles in other
grammars. Since I agree with Zwicky (1985) that the term particle is of no
analytical value, and since I find these little words to appear as structuring
elements in texts, I believe it is more useful to group them together in this
super-syntactic category.
Conversation words, such as hə?, 'yes', and nə?tti, 'no', belong in this
class (4.36 i). Words that indicate summation or reflection on a preceding
passage, like picenjo?, 'therefore', and naše, 'truth', are also included (ii). The
deictic time words dey 'now', and kay 'then' are commonly used to structure
narratives, as are some related expressions like de gahi, 'from there', shown in
(iii). There are also several Spanish imports in the set of discourse markers,
such as bweno (bueno, 'good; ok'), pwes, (pues, 'well), and ?entonses (entonces,
'then') (iv).
