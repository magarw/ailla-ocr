Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
8.3. Dependent verb constructions
There are also dependent verb constructions in which neither V1 nor V2
is an auxiliary. There are a few examples in which V1 has an aspectual
meaning, as shown in examples (8.12 i) and (ii), and perhaps example (iii).
There are also some examples in which V1 indicates direction of motion, as
shown in (iv). In these cases, V1 functions as an auxiliary. In RRG terms, it is a
nuclear operator modifying the aspectual or directional character of the event
denoted by V2. The only surprising thing about these constructions is that
there aren't more of them, since there are many examples of compounds that
include a root with aspectual or directional meaning.
