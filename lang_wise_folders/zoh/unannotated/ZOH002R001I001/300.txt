11.2 Coordination and disjunction
Clauses are usually conjoined by means of the Spanish connective ?i, (y,
'and'), as shown in example (11.10 i). They can also be coordinated by simple
juxtaposition, with no connective, as shown in example (ii). This was probably
the standard form of coordination prior to the invasion, although it appears
infrequently now in the corpus. The intonation pattern in such constructions is
like that used in a list of nouns: each conjunct has its own rising-falling
contour, with a slight pause between the two. The drop in pitch in the first
conjunct is not as steep as it would be if it were truly the end of the utterance.

There is no restriction on conjuncts with respect to aspect, mood, or
polarity. In example (11.11 i) completive clauses are conjoined with an
incompletive (which indicates an ongoing action in the past, in this case). In (ii),
an incompletive clause with future reference is conjoined with a present perfect
clause. In (iii), an incompletive clause (a purpose clause) is conjoined with a
volitive clause. Example (iv) shows the conjunction of positive and negative
incompletive clauses.
