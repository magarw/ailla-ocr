Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
The set of auxiliaries consists of six intransitive verbs of motion, aspect
or manner. All of these also function as independent verbs and appear in
compound verb constructions. Other verbs that occasionally behave like
auxiliaries (such as tuk-, 'to finish') are discussed in chapter 8.
