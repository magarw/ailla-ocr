applicative, antipassive, passive, and impersonal) and discuss their effects on
the argument structure of the clause. There is additional discussion of inverse
clauses in the section on the applicative suffix. Section 6.4. describes the basic
facts about word order in MIG Zoque; discussion of variation in word order for
narrative purposes is continued in chapter 14. Section 6.5. describes predicate
clauses and section 6.7. describes clauses using the MIG Zoque existential
terms, tehi-, 'there are', and n…ônti, 'there aren't'.
6.1. The arguments of a verb
The pronominal agreement markers indicate the subjects of transitive
and intransitive verbs and the objects of transitive verbs. Other core arguments
may be referenced by a plural suffix or implied by the causative or applicative
affixes. (The details of these cases are discussed below). Noun phrases that
are cross-referenced by these verbal elements are unmarked in MIG Zoque.
There are no morphological cases or adpositions that distinguish the roles of
core NP arguments, nor are they constrained to appear in specific positions with
respect to the verb. There is a possible total of four core arguments: actor,
undergoer, recipient (or benefactor or location the third argument), and
causer.
Every verb will specify at least one of the macroroles actor and undergoer
(defined in chapter 2). Both will be specified by a transitive verb; either may be
the single argument of an intransitive verb. In general, actors in MIG Zoque
clauses may be humans, animals, or other quasi-animate entities like the wind
or the river. Only a few of the semantic roles subsumed under the macrorole
'actor', as defined by RRG (Van Valin and La Polla, 1997:140-141) are actually
allowed as subjects of MIG Zoque clauses: agent, experiencer, recipient, and
