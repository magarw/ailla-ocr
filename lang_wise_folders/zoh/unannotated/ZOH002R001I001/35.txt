Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chapter 2: Grammatical Overview
MIG Zoque is an ergative, polysynthetic language with an abundance of
highly-productive word formation processes including verb stem compounding
and noun incorporation. It is a head-marking language (Nichols, 1983):
pronominal agreement markers that agree with actor and undergoer arguments
appear at the left edge of the verb complex. (A table of agreement markers
appears in section 5.1. Discussion of agreement appears in section 6.2.)
Dependents of the verb are not case-marked; nor are nouns, adjectives or
determiners marked for agreement with one another in any way. Word order of
constituent phrases inside a clause is free, except that the actor NP must
precede the undergoer NP if it is possible to confuse them (if they are both
human, for example).
This language exhibits many features of typological interest.
Phonologically, it is typical of a MesoAmerican language (discussed in chapter
3). Its morpheme classes include a set of body-part prefixes, which is more
common among languages north of the MA area (chapter 7). There is also a
class of positional verb roots that identify particular shapes or postures of the
human body, and of inanimate objects. This feature is shared by other MZ
languages and also Mayan languages (England, 1983), but is otherwise unusual,
at least in MesoAmerica. Positional verbs are discussed in chapter 4; a set of
positional suffixes is discussed in chapter 7.
MIG Zoque has a set of auxiliary verbs, similar to those found in other MZ
languages. This is another connection with Mayan languages, which also have
auxiliary verbs with similar semantic and syntactic properties. (See Zavala,
