Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
(which I counted separately). An example of this usage is shown in (14.13 i). In
verbs of speaking and perception, the preferred position for the subject is after
the verb, regardless of its newness as information. In the next example (ii-iii),
the discourse entity "the people" is introduced in a VSO clause on line 0447.
The subsequent stretch of texts details the complaints that people may bring to
the saint for curing, with no further explicit mention of "the people". The
discourse entity is then refreshed on line 059, with the NP positioned before the
transitive verb. The next section is topically different: now Sr. Omobono
Sánchez Miguel describes the planning for the saint's fiesta and all the fine
things the people do to celebrate her miracles.

7 I count an NP that appears between the auxiliary and the main verb as an instance of VS
order, to distinguish it from cases in which the NP precedes the whole auxiliary phrase.
