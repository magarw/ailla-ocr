'We'll come to finish this, so we can go, we can arrive at home."
Future tense can be indicated by an auxiliary verb construction with the
directional verb root nək- 'to go', similar to the periphrastic future
constructions in English and Spanish. But in MIG Zoque, nək- always adds its
directional sense to the meaning of the utterance; that is, it is only used when
the actor will actually move through space to perform the act in question. This
constrasts with the usage in English and Spanish, in which 'go' can be used for a
future situation that does not involve motion. If I say "I'm going to finish this
chapter today", I will do so by remaining seated at my desk. In Zoque, I could
only say that if I had to move to the desk to sit down and start writing.
