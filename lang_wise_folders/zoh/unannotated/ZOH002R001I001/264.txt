9.5.1 Quantity words
There is some overlap in meaning among the six quantity words. ?ičíŋ,
Poméŋ, and meši all specify a small quantity, 'few; a little'. məhmə and šəhə?
both specify a large quantity, 'many; a lot'. Syntactically, məhmə, šəhə?, and
meši exhibit the same behavior: they can either quantify nouns or function as
pronouns, and all can be made into verbs with the versive .?a. There are no
versive forms of either hemhi? or ?ičín. hemhi? is unique in its ability to co-
occur with the definite article. Pičín functions most commonly as an adverb,
limiting the scope of the action (e.g., "hurry a little"), but it can also be used to
limit a quantity of objects. ?oméŋ may no longer be in common use I found
no example of it in the corpus, apart from its entry in the lexicon.
məhmə and šəhə? are very similar in most respects, except that šəhə?
can not be used to quantify mass entities, such as water or salt. məhmə can be
used of any kind of object, and appears much more frequently in the corpus. It
can also be used as an intensifier with adverbs (example 9.14 i) and verbs (ii).
