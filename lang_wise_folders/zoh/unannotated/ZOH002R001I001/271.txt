'The people of the town are happy.'
When +haa? appears with a third person entity, it adds a distributive
meaning. It is used with number words to mean 'one by one', 'two by two', etc.,
as shown in example (9.20 i). tumhá?, 'one+NPL2' is also translated 'each' in
the appropriate context (ii)5. It is used with measure nouns to mean 'unit by
unit', as shown in example (iii). Examples (iv and v) illustrate the distributional
meaning most clearly. In (iv), the men are worried about their families, since
they're far away from home working on an endless dictionary project. But each
man is concerned about his own family, not about all the families as a unified
set. In (v), a group of students is about to enter a dark cave, so each gets his or
her own lamp.
