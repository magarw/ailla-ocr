Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
(see table 5.2). The second verb is inflected with one of the two dependent
suffixes: -E if the first verb has completive aspect, and -wǝ if it is in the
incompletive or a non-declarative mood. Only the second verb is marked for
agreement with the subject (and object), and the agreement marker is always
selected from the ergative set, regardless of the transitivity of the verb root.
This ergative shift is discussed further in Chapter 8. Example (4.9 i) shows a
dependent construction with incompletive aspect, and (ii) shows a dependent
construction with completive aspect.

Generally, dependent verb constructions can be translated "V1 while V2-
ing" (e.g., 'whistle while working'). Auxiliary verbs are consistently translated as
"Aux to V1" (e.g., 'begin to sow', 'know how to speak Zoque'). As a set, they
meet Steele's cross-linguistic criteria for auxiliary verbs (1981): they are a
small, closed set; they are constituents (contrasted with verb root compounds,
section 8.3); and some of them mark tense and mood. The two most frequently
used auxiliary verbs, n?k-, 'to go', and min-, 'to come', indicate the direction of
motion of the dependent verb. Direction is considered an operator of equal
syntactic status as tense in RRG (Van Valin & La Polla, 1997:42-3).
