Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
I call these measure nouns, because the first ones that I encountered

holding something in the closed fist (a fistful). When the event expressed by
the verb stem implies some sort of spatial limit, this suffix will predictably
produce a noun identifying that limit.
