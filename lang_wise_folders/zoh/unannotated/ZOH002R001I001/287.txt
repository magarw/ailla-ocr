Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
The incorporated patient must be non-specific; that is, it must be an
uncounted, indefinite, entity. I can say that I am going to 'tree-cut', but I can't
point to a particular tree and then say "I will tree-cut (that one)". Example (10.9
i) is ungrammatical: determiners, deictics, and definite quantifiers can not be
stranded, because they would make the incorporated noun specific.
(10.9)
(i)
* dø yotekommø yødø
də+ yote?-kom-wǝ
yədə
1 A+ clothes-mend-COM this
* 'I clothes-mended these'
NI thus serves as a means of modifying the verb, narrowing its denotation
to a particular subtype of action. In example (10.10 i), 'to coffee-drink' is
actually the common idiom for 'to eat breakfast'. While it generally involves
drinking coffee, it doesn't specify one cup or two, and most likely includes
eating a piece of bread as well. In texts, NI can be a way of describing the
action that is being performed without introducing an essentially irrelevant
entity into the discourse context (ii). The beans have nothing to do with the
story told in this text; the narrator is just setting up the background by
explaining what they were doing at the beginning of the story.
