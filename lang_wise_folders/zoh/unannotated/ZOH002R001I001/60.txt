3.3.4. Voice assimilation
Generally, intervocalic stops are voiceless, but the voiceless stop
consonants /p,t,k/ may become voiced when surrounded by members from the
set {vowels, nasals, /y/}. This process is variable, depending on speaker, rate
and carefulness of speech, and on the semantic prominence of the morpheme
in question. Consonants of verb roots, for example, are rarely affected (3.8 i),
nor are the instrumental suffix -kuy? (i) or incompletive -pa (ii). Suffixes like
repetitive -ke?t (iii) and first/second plural -tam (iv) are always voiced in such
contexts.
