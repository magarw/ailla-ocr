Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
13.1.6. Temporal modifiers
Modifiers that serve to focus the aspectual viewpoint or temporal
reference of a clause are found at every level of the grammar: verbal affixes,
clitics, verb roots in compound constructions, words such as deictics and
temporal adverbs, and temporal subordinate clauses.
13.1.6.1. Adverbial suffixes
There are five verbal affixes that affect aspect: the prefix yuk- 'to begin
V-ing'; the suffix -ke?t, 'to V once again'; the complex suffix -(pak)pə, 'to V
rapidly; all at once'; and the iterative suffixes -way and -ney, 'to V repeatedly;
with force'.
yuk- is a verbal prefix that can indicate an upward direction with verb
roots that involve motion, holding, or carrying, as illustrated in examples
(13.16 i-ii). It can also appear with any kind of verb root to mean 'to begin V-
ing' (iii). This prefix is also discussed in section 7.1.1.10.
