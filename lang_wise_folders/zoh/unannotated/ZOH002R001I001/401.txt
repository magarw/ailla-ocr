Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
deictic bases: dey and gay (kay utterance-initially), the neutral and distal forms,
respectively¹0. Both of these are used for sequencing events within the
narrative not for structuring sections of the narrative itself. The distal gay
places an event in a narrative time that is more distant from the present time of
narration, while the neutral dey refers to a time somewhat closer to the present.
Since stories often begin at the beginning of an important event, such as the
finding of Santa Juanita, and continue up to the recent past, there is often a
preponderance of gay's at the beginning of a narrative that are gradually
displaced by dey's as the story approaches the present. Sr. Sánchez makes
particularly skillful use of the contrast in 'Satornino and the Soldiers'. The
examples in (14.19) come from the end of the narrative, and provide a clear
illustration. Satornino has just told his wife about the events of the day. He
told her that he took some soldiers monkey-hunting, that they were unable to
shoot any but that he shot two down with his bola. She asks if they paid him,
and he assures her that they did. In example (i), she is asking him what
happened next in the story - what did the soldiers do after they paid Satornino.
His reply (ii) refers to that past time: they stayed at the mayor's. In (iii), he
brings his story-within-a-story up to the present, saying that now he is back,
and now they can see what they will do with themselves (he doesn't know or
care). Example (iv) also shows the use of proximal yey to refer to the near
future, contrasting with the present time reference of dey.

yey, the proximal temporal adverb, means 'right away' or 'soon', and is only used in dialog:
'entonse yey dø witupa nømmø satornino
Pentonse yey də+ witu?-pa 0 nəm-wə satornino
then
now 1 A+ return-INC 3A say-COM satornino
'Then, "I'll be right back", said Satornino.'
