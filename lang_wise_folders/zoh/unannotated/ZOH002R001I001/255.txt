Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chaper 9: Noun Phrases
In this chapter, I set forth the components of noun phrases (9.1) with a
description of possible orderings amoung these parts. I then describe the
function of each part. The definite article and the issue of definiteness in
general are discussed in section 9.2. Modification with adjectives is described
in section 9.3. Nominal compounds are described in section 9.4. The set of
MIG Zoque quantifiers, including the plural clitic +haa? (NPL2), is discussed in
section 9.5. Coordination and comparison in noun phrases are described in
section 9.6. Possessed nouns are described in section 9.7. Although relative
clauses are properly components of noun phrases, they are discussed in
chapter 11 because they share characteristics with other kinds of subordinate
clauses.
9.1. Components of a noun phrase
The components of a MIG Zoque noun phrase are quantifiers, deictics,
the definite article bi, adjectives, nouns (which may be compounded),
possessed nouns, relative clauses, and postpositions such as locatives and
?«ùyti?, 'of; about'. The noun phrases found in the corpus are usually simple in
terms of structure and number of components, most commonly including only
a deictic and a noun. Deictics are vastly more common than the definite article.
Relative clauses seem to be the preferred means of supplying additional
information about characters and objects in Zoque narratives, so quantifiers
and adjectives are rare.
While the order of noun phrases in a clause is free, the order of
components within a noun phrase is not. The general schema is shown below:
