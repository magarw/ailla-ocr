Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chapter 4: Word Classes
I define 12 classes of words for MIG Zoque: verbs, nouns, pronouns,
quantifiers (including numbers), adjectives, deictics, postpositions, adverbs,
intensifiers, subordinators, modals, and discourse markers. Criteria used for
determining class membership are either formal or functional.
The class of verb roots (section 4.1) is determined formally by the affixes
that are required for these roots to appear in words. Verb roots are not
considered words, since they never appear without at least minimal inflection
(section 2.1) and an agreement marker (section 6.2) or a nominalizing affix
(section 7.2). A verbal word, then, would be a verb stem with the obligatory
inflection and whatever optional affixes it might have. Verb stems can also be
formed from nouns and adjectives (section 7.3). A verbal word requires
marking with one of the agreement markers, which are clitics that lean to the
left and so form part of the phonological word preceding the verb word. The
clitic's host word might be a negative or volitive morpheme, which also belongs
syntactically to the verb phrase. It is clearer and simpler to refer to the whole
agglomeration (shown in table 2.1) as a verb complex. The term verb stem is
used in this book to refer to something more than a root but less than a
complex; for example, a root with a directional prefix would be considered a
stem.
The other classes are lexeme classes, some of whose members may be
monomorphemes and some of which may be derived forms. Functionally,
nouns (section 4.2), pronouns (section 4.3), quantifiers (section 4.4), and
deictics (section 4.6) can fill argument roles. The argument structure of verbs
