Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
When positionals appear as the only root in a verbal complex, the
meaning is usually a concretization of the abstract sense, along the lines of
pit- 'to roll a cigar' (by wrapping the tobacco leaf around and around), or jup-
'to pull' (a long thing like a rope, so that it ends up stretched out). In
constructions with compound verb roots, the abstract sense will usually
predominate. Further discussion of this phenomenon appears in chapter 8.
The glosses given in (4.9) are those that pertain to the verb root
functioning by itself in the verbal complex. The examples given in (4.10) show
that it is the resulting shape or position of the patient that matters, not the
specific means of achieving that position or the nature of the patient itself.
