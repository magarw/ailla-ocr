Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chapter 3: Phonology
This chapter presents the phoneme inventory of MIG Zoque, notes about
prosody, including stress and syllable structure, and the morphophonological
processes that occur.
The phonology of MIG Zoque is typical of a MesoAmerican language,
sharing nearly all of the traits described for the area in Cambell, Kaufman, and
Smith-Stark, 1986 (pp. 537-544). The phoneme inventory does not include any
contrastive (underlying) voiced stops or fricatives. There are no uvular,
aspirated, or implosive consonants, and there are no retroflexed sounds (apart
from Spanish loan words). The vowel inventory includes the 'sixth' vowel /ə/,
discussed below. There are no tones, and there are no vowel sequences, other
than those produced by the process of glide deletion (3.3.10).
MIG Zoque has some phonological processes that are similar to those of
many other MesoAmerican languages: voicing of obstruents after sonorants,
fixed stress (on the penultimate syllable), and a limited form of vowel harmony.
MIG Zoque does not have the striking metathesis process of Copainlá (Chiapas)
Zoque (Wonderley, 1951:117-118), in which glides and glottal stops
metathesize with obstruents and sonorant consonants, respectively. The most
unusual process in MIG Zoque is the gemination of final consonants discussed
in section 3.3.1. This process does not occur in either Copainalá Zoque or in
Sierra Popoluca (Veracruz) Zoque (Himes, 1997).
