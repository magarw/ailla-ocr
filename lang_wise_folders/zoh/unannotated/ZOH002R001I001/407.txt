14.13.3. Beginners and enders
We've just seen the use of entonses as a story beginner, meaning
something like 'once upon a time.' Speakers often literally begin to speak by
saying either "I'm going to tell you a story about X", or by simply saying bweno,
'ok'. Some speakers also use bweno to restart the narrative after a digression.
In (14.26 ii), Sr. Sánchez is returning to the events in the narrative, after a
section of dialog in which the lieutenant tries to persuade Satornino to join his
band of soldiers. (All the speakers occasionally slip into first person, even when
elling a third-person narrative. This example refers to the group of Satornino
and the soldiers.)
