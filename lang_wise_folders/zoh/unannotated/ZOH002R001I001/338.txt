12.4.3. Irrealis mo?
This modal suggests that the thing or event in question
might not exist or transpire; hence its designation as an irrealis. It
is often translated with the Spanish future tense, which can be used
for conjectures. mo? is also used as a softener to make a question
more polite, as shown in examples (12.11 iii-iv) 5.

5 In this text, Sr. Germán Sánchez Morales is interviewing Sr. Omobono Sánchez
Miguel about traditional medicine. They have known each other since childhood,
of course, but are here acting in their professional roles: linguistic consultant
and healer. Sr. Sánchez Morales often played the interviewer, as a way of
getting people to talk more and to flesh out their stories or explanations; if I did
it, they would politely accommodate to my language problems by switching to
Spanish.
