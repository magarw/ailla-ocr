Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Core arguments are those that are specified by the lexical entry for a verb
root or other predicate. The set may be increased or decreased by derivational
processes, such as the addition of affixes such as causatives or passives. In
MIG Zoque, the subject of a verb (either transitive or intransitive) and the object
of a transitive verb are realized by the pronominal agreement marker. Any core
argument may be referenced by a plural suffix on the verb (section 6.2). Noun
phrases that co-reference core arguments are optional; their appearance is
governed by discourse considerations such as focus and recency.
According to Foley and Van Valin (1984:79), "The main coding feature
distinguishing core from peripheral arguments is that core arguments tend to
occur in unmarked morphological or syntactic forms and peripheral arguments
in marked, often adpositional, codings." In English, core arguments are
syntactically marked by their position with respect to the verb. In a simple
transitive clause, the subject is that argument that occurs to the left of the verb,
while the object appears to the right. Additional arguments, such as time or
place, will typically be marked by a preposition. In MIG Zoque, noun phrases
co-referenced with core arguments are not marked by case endings¹, position
in the clause, or adpositions. Oblique arguments, such as locations and
instruments, are marked by postpositions (section 4.7).
1 MAR Zoque has case markings for core arguments: +?is, ergative, and +kə, absolutive
(Kaufman, p.c.).
