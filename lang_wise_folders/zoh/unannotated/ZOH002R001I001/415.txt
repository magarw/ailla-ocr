classification code in parentheses. The underlying form of the lexeme comes
last, written between //.
t@nh vt cortar, con una machete o fierro // to cut, with a machete or
iron tool. Ex: 7@y+ t@nh.ten-W@. [7@y t@nhtenn@]. Lo tiene
cortado. // He had it all cut. Sup: 1 t@nh.7oy %t@nh (T3). Underlying
form: //t@nh//.
The semantic field (SEMF) may also be of interest for searches. Entries for
the names of plants and animals use this field to indicate the ethno-biological
group to which the lexeme belongs, such as ?okoš, 'shrub', for short leafy
plants. These items can be found by entering EZ or EB in the semantic field
box. I have also used the SEMF field to make a rough lexical categorization of
verb roots. The categories are listed in table A.4. Some roots may belong to
more than one category; for example, caŋ-, 'to hit with the fist', is categorized
as both hit and hand. ?aŋ-, 'to warm by the fire', belongs to all of the
categories fire, temp, cook, and body.
