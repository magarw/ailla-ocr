Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
of the verbal complex in every other respect.
Of the eleven position classes, only 2, Pronominal agreement markers,
and 10, (Tense) Aspect Mood, are obligatory. Thus, the minimal MIG Zoque
verb consists of three positions, Pron + V + Infl (2 + 5 + 10), as illustrated in
the following examples.

3A go-COM 3E+ grasp-dCOM

'øm tzøkø'
?əm cək-A?
2E+ do-IMPV
'Do it!'
As the preceding examples show, it is not necessary for overt nominal
expressions to appear as the arguments of verbs, although it is possible. When
nouns do appear in core argument roles, if more than one role is played by a
human referent, the actor argument will come first; otherwise, word order is
free.
