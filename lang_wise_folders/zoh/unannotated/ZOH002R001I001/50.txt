Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
3.1. Phonemes
MIG Zoque has a rather small phonemic inventory, consisting of 12
consonants and 6 vowels. The first two charts shown below (tables 3.1 and 3.2)
include only the native phonemes. The third one (table 3.3), gives the set of
non-native consonants that appear in words in the MIG Zoque lexicon. Some of
these appear in Zoque words, derived by regular phonological processes
(discussed in the subsections below); others were borrowed along with Spanish
loan words.
