It should be noted that this language provides many means of adding
directional and positional information directly to the verb, in the form of
directional prefixes, positional suffixes, and compounds including a motion
verb. So, for example, although there is no adverb that means 'through', this
sense can be conveyed in different ways depending on what is passing or has
passed through what. In the following examples, (i) is a description of a
drawing of a piece of paper on a spindle; the spike passed through the paper.
Example (ii) shows the common formulation for expressing the directional
'through', as in walking through water or through the town. In example (iii),
kuk 'center' appears again, expressing the notion of cutting directly across the
street.
