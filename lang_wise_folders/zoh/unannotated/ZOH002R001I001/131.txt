Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimapala Zoque
5.5.3. Spanish negatives
The Spanish function word ni 'neither' appears in many places in the
corpus. There is no precisely corresponding Zoque word, since the negative ya
doesn't carry the specifically contrastive sense of ni. The Spanish negative no
appears quite rarely, and perhaps examples such as the one shown below are
best regarded as simple speech errors.
