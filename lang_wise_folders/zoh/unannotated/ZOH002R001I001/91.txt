Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Adjectives can appear either before or after the noun, but in the
postnominal case the adjective is marked with the relativizer +V?k (+p??k) after

Proximal yǝ- (DCT1) means closer to the speaker: 'this' in English; este/a
in Spanish. Neutral de- (DCT2) deictics indicate a vague middle ground rather
than closeness to the listener; they are glossed with the Spanish neutral, ese/a,
