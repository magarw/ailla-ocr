Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
This process frequently results in the use of speech sounds that are not
part of the regular MIG Zoque inventory. There may be some assimilation of
the final consonant of the Spanish stem, although sometimes an apparently
hard-to-pronounce form is left unchanged (compare examples 7.35 ii and iii).
If the Spanish stem vowel (a, e, or i) is dropped, the preceding vowel is
lengthened. If this would result in a consonant cluster, the stem vowel is
retained (examples 7.35 v and vi).
This is an extremely common process, since all living speakers of MIG
Zoque are bilingual and many Spanish words are simply more readily available
to the tongue. Spanish verbs have apparently replaced whole lexical categories
(probably quite long ago), such as religion, cognition, and emotion. It is very
difficult to find Zoque words in these domains, and some of those that appear
in texts are not readily recognized by other speakers. I include the whole
Spanish infinitive form in the morpheme breakdown line for clarity.
