Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chapter 13: Aspect and Mood
The main indicators of aspect or mood in MIG Zoque are the mutually
exclusive set of suffixes that may appear in position 10 of the verb complex, as
shown in table 2.1. These suffixes offer two choices for aspect: completive
(section 13.1.1) or incompletive (13.1.4). There are syntactic means for
constructing perfects (13.1.2), a remote perfect (13.1.3.), and progessives
(13.1.5). Satellite forms that contribute to the aspect of a particular expression
include a small set of adverbial suffixes (13.1.6.1), two clitic morphemes
(13.1.6.2), a small set of verbs used in compound verb constructions (13.1.6.3),
and temporal adverbs, deictics and clauses (13.1.6.4). The position 10 suffixes
offer four choices for mood (other than the declarative): imperative (13.2.1),
negative imperative (13.2.2), hortative (13.2.3), or optative (13.2.4). There are
also three modal morphemes expressing different degrees of possibility
(13.2.5-6).
MIG Zoque does not have a system of inflection for tense. Location of an
event at a particular time is done by means of temporal adjuncts. This is typical
of MesoAmerican languages, areally speaking (Campbell, et al. 1986).
13.1. Aspect
The aspectual system of MIG Zoque offers a choice of two viewpoints, the
perfective and the imperfective. These are termed the completive and
incompletive, respectively, in MesoAmerican linguistics, to avoid confusion with
the terms 'perfective' and 'imperfective' used in the Spanish tense system (and
others). The choice of one of these viewpoints is obligatory. Both the
