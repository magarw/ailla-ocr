Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Appendix A: The MIG Zoque lexicon
The version of the lexicon that was used in the writing of this grammar
can be found at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America,
resource identifier ZOH004R001. This is a plain text Shoebox 2.0 output file,
also available in PDF format. The PDF version is publically accessible. This
database was produced mainly by me, but significant numbers of entries were
made by Terrence Kaufman, and all entries have been reviewed by him. The
primary consultant for the lexicon was Germán Sánchez Morales, although most
of the entries were reviewed with other speakers.
Lexicons for this and other MesoAmerican languages were developed by
the MesoAmerican Languages Documentation Project using Shoebox 2.0
databases. They are gradually being made available as on-line databases;
currently, those of MIG Zoque and Oluta Mixe (Roberto Zavala Maldonado) are
accessible at the MALDP web site, and the Santa María Chimalapa Zoque lexicon
(Terrence Kaufman) will appear soon.
An entry in the database is composed of many labelled fields, each of
which contains a line of textual information about the lexeme. Many of these
fields can be used as search criteria, in accordance with the instructions on the
web page. Unfortunately, the system requires some prior knowledge of how
the entries are composed and what sorts of information can be found in a given
field; providing that information is the object of this appendix.
Table A.1 gives the complete list of field names and with descriptions of
their contents. Not all of these fields are used in every lexical entry, and some
of them are peculiar to my lexicon. Entries are keyed by the lexeme, which is
entered in its underlying form.
