Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Existential predicates can be presented as completed (past) situations by
using the verb root tih- with completive aspect¹.

tehi.?a-, 'there is', with completive aspect, means 'to be located' or 'to be
present with' (similar to Spanish estar), as shown in examples (13.3 i-ii).
Incompletive aspect seems to be used only to present the situation of being
somewhere for an indeterminate period of time in the past. The contrast is
illustrated by a few lines from a text about a fellow who didn't get along well
with the other consultants on the MALDP project. At first, he went around with
them and was together with them (iii), but later he 'went over to the other side2¹
¹ Remember that existential predicates do not employ a verb to convey a present situation
(section 6.6). There is no copular verb in Zoque analogous to the Spanish verb ser, 'to be', that
appears with incompletive aspect.

This is a pun: el otro lado, 'the other side' is slang for 'the United States' (the other side of the
border), and it also refers to the other end of the long dinner table in Catemaco. We generally
segregated at meals, so the (mostly American) linguists could talk in English about linguistics
(is there another topic?), and the Indians could get a break from the endless lexical inquiry.
