syllables is similar in both cases, however: the preceding vowel or consonant is
strongly laryngealized.
3.3. Morphophonological processes
3.3.1. Gemination
When the completive suffix -wǝ or a glottal stop initial suffix (-7əy,
passive -?əm, or antipassive -?oy) is attached to a stem ending in a consonant,
the /w/ or /?/ disappears and the final consonant is geminated. This does not
occur if the stem-final coda consists of a (?)Cš cluster. In that case, the /w/ or
/?/ is simply deleted. (More examples illustrating the gemination caused by
each of these suffixes can be seen in sections 5.2.1, 6.3.3, 6.3.4, and 7.1.3.)
There are thus two rules:
