4.10. Subordinators
Subordinators mark subordinate clauses, which are discussed in detail in
chapter 11. A list of these forms is shown in table 4.7. The relativizers +V?k
(REL) and +hi? (LOC_REL) are included in this class even though they are clitics,
not words, because (a) they share the function of subordinating clauses, and (b)
they alternate with Spanish subordinators (que, 'that', and donde, 'where',
respectively) like the other members of this class.

Spanish subordinators have been freely borrowed into MIG Zoque, as is
the case in many MesoAmerican languages (Thompson and Longacre, 1985).
