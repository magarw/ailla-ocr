Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
3.2. Prosody
3.2.1. Stress
MIG Zoque words have primary stress on the penultimate syllable. Final
stress (which will always be marked with an accent in the examples) may arise
for one of two reasons: the word is a loan word from Spanish, borrowed with
the original stress intact; or, two syllables have been collapsed by a
morphophonological rule (section 3.3.8). In some cases this contraction may
have occurred at an earlier stage of the language, but it also remains as an
ongoing process.
The first example in (3.1) is of a word with regular, penultimate stress,
which is predictable and therefore not marked. Example (ii) is a Spanish loan
word borrowed with the original stress intact. Example (iii) is a MIG Zoque
word, whose irregular final stress developed at an earlier stage of the language.
In example (iv), the measure suffix -náŋ carries its own stress. It is usually
word-final (section 7.2.3). This morpheme is analyzed as having two vowels
underlyingly, which contract by the rule discussed in section 3.3.8 to yield a
single, stressed, syllable¹. Example (v) illustrates this process more clearly: the
irregular final stress is the result of the contraction of two syllables at the end
of the word.

Historical reconstruction is beyond the scope of this synchronic study of MIG Zoque
grammar. However, I need to look back in time for this suffix and for a few similar suffixes
used with deictic roots (section 4.6) in order to account for the irregular stress pattern.
