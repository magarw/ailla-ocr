'They see when there isn't any."
The verb root that means 'to hear' is matoŋ-. It occurs only rarely in the
corpus, but elicitation sessions revealed that the syntax of its use parallels that
of ?iš-, 'to see'. It can introduce a subordinate clause described the perceived
event, with or without the borrowed complementizer ke.

11.9.3. Cognition.
In this section, we look at an assortment of verbs that express cognitive
events, such as wanting, knowing, and thinking.
te?- means 'to want'. As an independent root it can be used transitively
(example i) or to introduce a subordinate clause, with or without ke (ii-iii). te?-
is most commonly used as the second root in a compound verb construction,
which will be discussed in chapter 8. In those constructions it means 'to want X
to V'.
