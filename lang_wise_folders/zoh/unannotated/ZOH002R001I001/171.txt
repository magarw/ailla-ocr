(ZOH001 R057- 041)
The verb root tih- 'to go and return' is used for past tense predicate
constructions. This could actually be a homophonous, but different, root
there are too few examples of this kind to speculate.

6.6. Existential clauses
There are MIG Zoque words meaning 'there is/are', tehi-, and 'there
isn't/aren't', nənti. Both of these words are locative expressions, and refer to
existence or presence in space, rather than to a state or condition.
tehi- appears to be the neutral deictic with a locative suffix. This stem
appears with the versive suffix -?a, VERS1, inflected for aspect and sometimes
number in the usual fashion. The last two syllables are often elided.
