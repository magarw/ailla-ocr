7.1.3. Perseverative ten
This suffix means roughly "to keep something V-ed", or perhaps more
precisely, "to V, and as a result to have something V-ed".
One of my
consultants often translated expressions with this suffix as "to V the day
before". It is the volitional counterpart of assumptive -ney, which does not
imply intentional action. Something can assume a position of having been
stretched, for example, without a human being deliberately doing the
stretching, but if –ten is used, the fact that the stretching was done deliberately
is made clear. Compare the first five examples shown below with examples in
(7.17) above.
