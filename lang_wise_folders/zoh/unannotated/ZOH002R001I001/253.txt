Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Olson refer to these as "causative serial verb constructions" (1985:25). Many
compounds involving directional verbs work this way: V1 tells us how the
agents moved the patient, and V2 tells us in what direction the patient was
moved.

In some compound verb constructions formed with ?iš-, 'to see', the
patient of the 'see' event is the agent or actor of the V2 event. So, in example
(8.36 i), the boy sees the man and the man is fishing7.

7 ?iš- also appears in several idiosyncratic compounds, such as ?iš=tuk- (see-finish) 'to wait',
and ?iš=pøk- (see=get) 'to recognize'. In these cases, both verbs share the same agent.
