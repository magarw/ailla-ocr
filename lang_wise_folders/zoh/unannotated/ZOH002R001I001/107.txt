4.8.2. Time adverbs
All of the MIG Zoque time words are listed in Appendix B. The language
divides the day into five parts: morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night.

proximal one indicates a time in the immediate future: 'right now', 'soon', 'in a
minute'. The neutral and distal time adverbs are both regularly translated with
ahora, 'now', but their specific reference depends on subtle characteristics of
the events in the narrative. They are much used as discourse markers, and will
