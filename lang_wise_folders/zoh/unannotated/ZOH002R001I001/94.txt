There is a limited sort of vowel harmony operating in the LOC1 and DIR1
sets of alternate forms, such that the vowel of the suffix is matched to the
vowel of the deictic root. This can be seen in the set of forms using the DIR1
postposition: yəhəəŋ, deheeŋ, gahaaŋ. There is also some redundancy among
the forms, with variant ways of saying the basic things: yəhə, yəhi? here'; gaha,
gahi? 'there'; yə?, yədə 'this', etc.
The initial consonants of the neutral de- and distal ga- are undoubtedly
underlyingly voiceless, given the phoneme inventory of this language (section
3.1), although they rarely appear unvoiced in the corpus. There are a few such
cases, however, usually at the beginning of an utterance. The distal temporal
form usually appears as kay instead of as gay. A distal directional also appears
in a common idiom with a voiceless initial consonant, as shown in example
(4.23 iii).
