Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
agreement markers even though the valency of the whole construction is
intransitive. In (i), V2 is made intransitive by the addition of the antipassive
suffix; in (v), it is intransitive because the patient - tuhkuy?, 'gun' - has been
incorporated. The absolutive dǝ+ (1A) appears in example (ii) because the
clause is in the inverse: the third person agents of V2 are searching for a first
person patient, so the more important first person argument must be explicitly
marked. In example (vii), both the auxiliary and V2 are inflected directly for
mood. Double marking only occurs with this particular construction: the
auxiliary nək- and the hortative mood. It is a very common way to say "Let's go
do something!".
