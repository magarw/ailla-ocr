'axux poj

'garlic vine'
It can be difficult to determine if a compound is actually one word or two.
Stress is the only clue, and if both parts have more than one syllable, it will not
be a definite guide. Some compounds are formed from nouns that no longer
appear independently in the language; these can be safely assumed to be one
word.
(9.11)
papon
pa=pən
wild-man
'devil'
(vi)
jamatin
hama=tin
day=shit
'money'
kotzøk mu'k
kocək mu?k
'hill grass'
(ii)
In the following example, primary stress falls on the penultimate syllable
of the compound, indicating that it is a single phonological word. (This is the
only example with this stress pattern in the corpus.)
235
'angway'
?aŋ=way?
mouth-hair
'beard'
In the next set of examples, stress falls on the penultimate syllable of
each part of the compound, or, in the case of a one-syllable component, on
that single syllable. The primary, strongest, stress for the whole is the primary
stress of the second component. This is the normal case for compounds with
components of more than one syllable.
