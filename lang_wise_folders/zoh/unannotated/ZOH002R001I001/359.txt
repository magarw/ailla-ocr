The celeritive suffix appears most commonly with verbs of motion or
carrying and has the meaning 'rapidly' or 'all at once'. It has two phonological
shapes: -pǝ? or -pakpə?. The second is obviously compositional, but I have no
idea what the pak morpheme might be. The celeritive appears only very rarely
in the corpus.

Verb complexes with the suffixes -ney (ITER1) and -way (ITER2) contain
reduplicated verb roots, and have an iterative or emphatic meaning. These
never appear with any other prefixes or suffixes. In the -ney constructions, the
verb root that bears the central meaning of the complex is reduplicated, as
shown in the following examples, all but the first taken from the lexicon.
