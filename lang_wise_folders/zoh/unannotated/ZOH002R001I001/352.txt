This usage
The incompletive is used for situations in the present.
generally occurs in dialogs when characters tell each what they're doing, as
shown in examples (13.11 i-ii). There are a few texts in which Sr. Sánchez
Morales is describing his current situation and thus uses the incompletive with
present reference. Example (iii) comes from a text that he recorded shortly
after hearing about the death of one of the consultants from the previous
summer's project. Example (iv) is from a text describing Sr. Sánchez's trip to
the project and the work he was doing there. He ends the account by
wondering when it will be over so we can all go home.
