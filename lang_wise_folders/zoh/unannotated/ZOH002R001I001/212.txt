cək- often combines with deverbal nouns, to yield a verb with much the
same meaning as the original, underived root, but with the focus on perhaps
some particular part of the event. This is a fine example of the stylistic range
available to the Zoque speaker.

This versive (VERS1) most commonly appears with adjectives with the
general meaning 'to become or be X' (examples 7.38 i and ii). It is also used to
form verbs from demonstratives, numbers, and other function morphemes
(examples iii-v). It verbalizes nouns, with the general meaning 'to have or do X'
(examples vi-viii). It also combines with the irregular stem tehi- to produce a
stem meaning 'to exist' or 'to be located' (example ix), and nənti?, 'there isn't'
(example x).
