If an example was elicited, the word 'elicited' appears in parentheses to
the right of the translation. If the example comes from a text, the number of
the source text and the line number are given in parentheses at the right of the
translation line. Texts are labelled with the Archive of the Idigenous Languages
of Latin America (AILLA) resource identifier (ZOH001R006) and the line number
(-001). If not otherwise specified, the example comes from the lexicon
(ZOH004R001). The texts and lexicon are publically accessible through AILLA.
1.5. Organization of the book
An overview of MIG Zoque grammar and a sketch of the theoretical
perspective adopted in this work are presented in chapter 2. A sketch of the
phonology is given in chapter 3. The word classes of MIG Zoque, including the
sub-classification of verbs, are defined and discussed in chapter 4. This
section includes the complete descriptions of pronouns and deictics.
Discussion of morphology is divided into two chapters: verbal inflectional
morphology is presented in chapter 5, and all derivational morphology in
chapter 7. (Only verbs have any inflectional morphology.) Chapter 6 contains a
description of the basic clause, which means single, declarative clauses. This
chapter includes discussion of verbal arguments, agreement, word order,
predicate and existential clauses. The valency-changing suffixes and their
effects on argument structure are also discussed here. Dependent verb
