Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
3.3.5. Glide absorption
When a suffix ending in /y/ (indirective -hay, assumptive -ney,
antipassive -?oy, or verbalizer -?ay) is followed by a suffix beginning with a
voiceless stop, such as the incompletive -pa or repetitive -ke?t, the stop may
be voiced (due to 3.3.4) and the glide deleted.
