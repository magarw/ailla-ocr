T3 verbs must be detransitivized with the antipassive suffix -?oy in order
to appear without objects. The antipassive forms of these verbs means to
perform the act in a general way, as in 'I'll harvest (some unspecified crops) in
the fall' or 'They were eating (some unspecified food)'. This class is by far the
largest of the transitive classes.
