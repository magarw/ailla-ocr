Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
When a discourse entity is first mentioned in an intransitive clause, it is
most likely to appear after the verb. This is true regardless of whether or not
the entity is human, inanimate, or an abstraction, such as a unit of time.

A common pattern used when introducing a new discourse entity is to
present a pair of clauses: in the first, the new information follows the verb; in
the second, the clause is essentially repeated, but with the now known
information preceding the verb (14.7 i-ii). This pattern is also used when the
first clause is transitive, and the new entity is the object of the transitive verb.
