Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
surface in any other environments. It is probably cognate with a suffix in
neighboring MAR Zoque -i?iŋ/-e?eŋ, which creates a unit of measure or unitary
event (Kaufman, p.c.). This in turn is clearly related to the MIG Zoque measure
suffix -naaŋ?/neeŋ, discussed in section 7.2.3. We can reasonably deduce that
the MIG Zoque numeral suffix is -?aŋ by the fact that there are geminate
consonants in the forms maktaššaŋ (4), moššaŋ (5), and makkaŋ (10). This
gemination would be regularly produced by a glottal-stop initial suffix in
accordance with the rule discussed in 3.3.1. Note further that the final syllable
in these two forms is not stressed, although in all the other forms it is stressed.
Final stress generally indicates that a syllable has been deleted (section 3.3.8).
We can thus deduce that the other forms had a final vowel, although we can not
know precisely which vowel it was.
The counting system is illustrated in example (4.19) with the numbers for
something-two. Numbers from 10 to 19 are formed by prefixing the basic
numbers with mak-. (Note that mak- is also used to mark the numbers 4,
maktaššaŋ, and 9, maktuhtáŋ.) Number twenty is a new morpheme, ?i?pšaŋ?.
Numbers 21 through 30 are formed with ?i?pšaŋ? followed by the numbers
from 1 to 10. At 31, we begin adding the prefix ko- to the second part of the
number. (This ko- is not to be confused with the verbal prefix discussed in
section 7.1.1). 40 is two twenties, 60 is three twenties, and so on.
