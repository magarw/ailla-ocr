The incompletive suffix is -pa. Wonderly defines the incompletive as
"action not yet completed or non-punctiliar action, usually but not always in
present or future time" (Wonderly, 1951:155). The progressive reading is the
most common in the corpus. Auxiliary constructions and certain verb
compounds are more commonly used to express future tense (chapter 8).
