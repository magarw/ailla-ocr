4.1.4. Affective verbs
Affective, or sound-symbolic, verbs rarely appear in texts but are easily
elicited. Affective verbs in MIG Zoque are examples of imitative sound
symbolism (Hinton, et.al. 1994). They typically represent rhythmic motions
(like shoes slapping or water dripping) or animal sounds. These words
sometimes include speech sounds that are not part of the native MIG Zoque
phoneme inventory, like /s/ and /I/. They are always reduplicated and marked
with the reduplicative suffix -ney. They can be used with either completive or
incompletive aspect.

4.1.5. Auxiliary verbs
Dependent verb constructions consist of a sequence of two verb

verb is inflected for aspect or mood using one of the eight independent suffixes
