Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Examples of its use are shown in (11.24 i-ii). ?iš- is extremely common
unadorned root, as a derived stem, and as a member of a pair of compound
roots. Its behavior in compounds is discussed in chapter 8. As an underived
root, it can be used to simply present an act of seeing (example iii), or to
introduce a clause describing the perceived situation (examples iv-vi). As
example (iv) illustrates, this can be an abstract situation perceived with the
mind.
