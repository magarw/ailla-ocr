Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
work began to organize itself into categories (noun phrases, agreement, etc.), I
occasionally translated example sentences from other grammars into Zoque
(Foley & Van Valin, 1984; Dixon, 1977; Craig, 1977; Aissen, 1987) to test the
grammatical possibilities discussed in those works. I tested my constructions
with both Sr. Sánchez and Sr. Miguel, correcting them as directed and noting
variations in grammaticality judgements. Corrections included pragmatic errors
as well as grammatical ones¹. Their judgements were generally consistent,
with minor differences such as Sr. Sánchez's preference for a middle ("it
happened") translation for passives as opposed to Sr. Miguel's preference for an
impersonal ("they did it") reading. Their judgements were always very clear,
ranging from praise for my astonishing cleverness to complete lack of
comprehension. My hand is visible in these sentences in that I tend to put the
verb first (since it required the most work to figure out) and I use the definite
article vastly more often than any Zoque speaker. The consultants invariably
volunteered numerous related sentences during these elicitation sessions,
which I included in the elicitation data set.
Wherever possible, I have tried to draw examples from the natural texts.
These are certain to be correct Zoque, and usually include enough context to
give a solid picture of the usage of the construction in question. When
paradigmatic data is relevant, these are nearly always drawn from the elicited
set. Finally, for examples of the various uses of some morpheme, such as a
particular prefix, I relied on the lexicon for complete sets of representative
samples.

Sr. Sánchez rejects examples in which things behave inappropriately. So, for example, tables
can't walk and trees can't cut people.
