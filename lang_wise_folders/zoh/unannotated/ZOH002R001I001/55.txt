There are many tokens in the corpus showing that the depositive suffix
way does not always have this effect; that is, the /w/ is clearly audible. There
are also tokens from several consultants (particularly older men) in which a /?/
fails to induce gemination, particularly after /ŋ/, and sometimes also after /y/
and /k/. There are no exceptions to the gemination induced by the completive
suffix -wə.
