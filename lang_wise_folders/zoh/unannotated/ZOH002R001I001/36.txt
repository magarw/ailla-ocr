Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
2000 for a discussion of auxiliaries as an areal feature.) Auxiliary verbs can be
compounded with a main verb root in complex lexical constructions in MIG
Zoque, as in the other MZ languages. However, in MIG Zoque these
constructions exhibit a range of expressive power that goes far beyond the
simple associated motion constructions described for Mayan languages, or the
serial verb constructions described in West African and South Asian languages
(Foley & Olson, 1985). Auxiliaries and verb compounds are discussed in
chapter 8.
MIG Zoque, like other MZ languages, exhibits a phenomenon known as
ergative, or dependent, shift in dependent verb constructions. This is not an
example of the split ergativity found in some Mayan languages (Kaufman,
1996), but appears to be a peculiarity of the MZ language family. Ergative shift
is also discussed in chapter 8. Another feature of the MIG Zoque agreement
system shared generally with other MZ languages is inverse role-marking, in
which first and second person patients are marked on the verb in preference to
third person agents. This situation is discussed in chapter 6. External
possession is another result of the person hierarchy (that prefers first and
second persons to third). In these constructions, the verb is marked to agree
with a first person possessor of the patient, rather than with a third person
agent. External possession is also discussed in chapter 6.
An affix template is a handy way to provide an overview of the
components of a verbal word. There are eleven slots or positions for clitics and
affixes in a MIG Zoque verb, shown in the table below. Position 1, Negative, is
better classified as a word rather than a clitic, but since it functionally belongs
to the verb complex it is included here for convenience.
