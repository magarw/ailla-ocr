11.4. Purpose clauses
The subordinator goo? (PURP) marks a purpose clause. While it most
typically appears immediately after the verb complex, it may also appear after
the first word or noun phrase in the clause. The Spanish subordinator para, 'in
order to', is also used to construct purpose clauses; in fact, both may appear
together, with the Spanish subordinator at the beginning of the clause and the
Zoque subordinator somewhere inside the clause. In the corpus, para alone
(11.16 i- ii) is more common than para together with goo? (iii - v), which in
turn is more common than just goo? (v-vii).
