8.3. Verb compounds
Verb complexes with compound stems are ubiquitous in MIG Zoque
discourse. Compounding stems is the most common means of expressing
adverbial modification, such as manner, means, and direction of motion. In this
section, I will first describe the morphosyntax of compounds, and then the
many functions that they serve.
8.3.1. Morphosyntax of verb compounds
The most common sort of compound consists of two unadorned roots.
Three-root compounds are rare. The last example shown below (8.15 v), is
debatably a three-root compound in MIG Zoque. The root tə?-, 'to want', is
cognate with a frustrative affix in other Zoquean languages (Wichmann, 1995;
Kaufman, 1996), and thus might be classified as an affix in MIG Zoque as well.
I analyze it as a verb root in this grammar, because that analysis seems simpler,
given the power of verb compounding in this language, than proposing that
some roots are actually affixes.
