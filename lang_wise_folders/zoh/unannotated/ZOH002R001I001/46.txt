Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
These examples illustrate two effects of borrowing at the phonological
and morphological levels. Neither /g/ nor /d/ are phonemes in MIG Zoque
(apart from the result of intervocalic voicing); these and other phonemes, such
as /s/, are generally confined to the borrowed words. Spanish inflectional
morphemes, like the plural /s/ of wakaš, vacas, are also confined to loan
words. There are no derivational morphemes borrowed from Spanish into MIG
Zoque.
Spanish verb stems are 'Zoque-fied' by being incorporated with the root
cək-, 'to do' (section 7.3.1), illustrated in example (2.6). Spanish verbal
inflections never appear in Zoque sentences, although the negative words no
and ni are sometimes used in addition to the MIG Zoque negative ya (section
5.5.3). Spanish pronouns only appear in relative clause constructions: ?el ke X,
él que X, 'he who X'.
