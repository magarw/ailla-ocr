Table 14.4: Transitive clauses
0.9
The most frequent type of clause includes an overt object NP (29.5%);
subjects are infrequently mentioned (4.8%). This makes sense, given that there
tend to be few characters in these stories, and the principal characters are
usually introduced with an intransitive (motion) verb. Objects provide the
details of a story: props, weapons, opponents, etc.
