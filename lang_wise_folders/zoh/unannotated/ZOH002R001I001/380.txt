Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
14.2. Word order and the presentation of information
Core arguments are marked on the verb in MIG Zoque (section 6.1), so
noun phrases that cross-reference these arguments are syntactically optional.
(Henceforth I will refer to such noun phrases as 'overt NPs'.) Thus, many
clauses in a Zoque text have no overt NPs whatsoever, and many more have
fewer than the valency of the verb allows (only the object of a transitive verb,
for example). When overt NPs do appear, their order with respect to one
another and to the verb is free, except that when there is a possibility of
confusion the subject must precede the object (section 6.4).
In this section, I will give some statistics based on the four texts
described above, identifying the types of clauses and numbers of arguments
that appear in various possible orders. I will also examine the presentation of
new and given information in each of the four texts more closely, discussing
the patterns of usage that appear.
14.2.1. Clauses by type
For the purposes of this chapter | identified four types of clauses:
transitive, intransitive, existential, and speaking. I lump verbs that allow two or
more arguments together into the transitive class, since there are very rarely
more than two overt NPs in any clause. Intransitive verbs allow one argument.
Existential clauses in MIG Zoque have no verb on which to mark arguments, so
the subject and predicate NPs appear overtly by necessity. They do not
therefore figure in to calculations of word order or number of overt arguments.
The speaking verbs nəm-, 'to say', and nəm.hay- (say.APPL), 'to say to
someone', are singled out because their behavior is somewhat different from
