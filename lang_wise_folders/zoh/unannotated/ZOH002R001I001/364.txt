There are a variety of stems that focus the final endpoint of a situation.
tuk- 'to finish' and šuk- 'to finish' are virtually identical, although tuk- is much
more common (examples 13.24 i-ii). My consultants say that the two are
interchangeable and can each be used with any sort of verb, but they always
use tuk- in their stories. ko.wak- is a stem derived from the root *wak-, which
no longer can be used independently in MIG Zoque. Its meaning is something
like 'to be empty', and it appears in many compounds and derived forms with
the connotation of emptying or clearing something out (iii). ?ok.wak- also
means 'to end', but I didn't find any examples of it in compound constructions.
tan- means specifically 'to complete', and is generally used in situations
involving quantities, such as payments for services rendered (iv). cak- means
'to leave off or stop V-ing', before the natural or expected termination of the
situation (v).
