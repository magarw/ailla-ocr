Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Attempts to construct sentences adding the passive suffix to roots from
the no-passives groups generally produced scowls and odd explanations that
seemed to pick up on a more abstract sense of the verb. For example, Sr.
Sánchez said that the sentence in (6.26 iii) was unacceptable because people
would understand it to mean that the rock was also broken (giving an
accompaniment interpretation for +pi?t.) The unacceptability of (iv) was said to
be due to the fact that the boy couldn't be doubled over a chair. This seems to
be picking out a very deep, abstract, connotation of nakš-, along the lines of 'to
be forked like a stick'. I've only seen one other usage of this root that picks up
that connotation, shown for convenience in example (v)5.

5 The context for this sentence is a story in which a boy falls off a short cliff onto the head of a
deer and lies spread out across the deer's antlers. The story was told from the picture book,
'Frog, Where Are You?' Sr. Camilo Miguel Sánchez invented the story on the fly, as an
interpretation of the pictures in the book.
