Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
The last text was narrated by Sr. Omobono Sánchez Miguel4, a local
practioner of traditional medicine. The title of this text is 'The Appearance of
Santa Juanita' (ZOH001R032). It tells the story of how he found his patron
saint, Santa Juanita de los Arcos, from whom his gift as a healer derives. He
was working on the crew that built the road up to San Miguel (sometime in the
early 1960's), when he was assigned to work on a hillside not far from town.
He pried loose a large boulder, and there behind it was a small hole, with the
plaster figure of Santa Juanita tucked inside. This was indeed a great miracle,
and he brought the saint home and began to celebrate her fiesta every year.
She taught him the healing arts, and people would come from all around to be
cured by her powers.
The first two texts are third person narratives, and consist chiefly of the
main character moving from place to place and talking with other characters.
The central action of the story - the killing of the monkeys or the finding of the
two-legged one is repeated in dialog several times. All stages of motion are
mentioned, typically following the pattern of plan ("let's go"), movement (they
went), and completion (they arrived). Dialog constitutes the bulk of a third
person narrative.
The second two texts are first person narratives, and contain little or no
dialog. Since these are accounts of daily events or things that happened
(usually at home) in the past, there is less description of the movements of the
main character (the narrator). There is more discussion of plans and results: "I
wait for my children to come home from school so I can feed them".
4 The astute reader will have noticed that everyone seems to have similar last names. This is
because they are all cousins, of some degree or another. Since Sr. Sánchez arranged our taping
consultations, we tended to work with his neighbors and relatives.
