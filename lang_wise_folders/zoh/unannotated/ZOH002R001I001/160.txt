Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
There are some cases in which the argument added by the applicative
suffix is opaque. (6.23 i) may mean 'He arrived to or for him, maybe'. There's a

6.2.3. Passive ?em
In a passive construction the undergoer of a verb becomes the subject
and the agent is suppressed. There are no passive constructions that allow the
overt expression of an agent, in a postpositional phrase or otherwise. It is
really most accurate to say that the passive suffix bleaches all the semantic
