14.2.2. Intransitive clauses
We'll look first at intransitive clauses, the simpler case. Table 14.2
divides the set of intransitive clauses into those with no argument, those with a
subject (almost always an actor - there are very few passive verbs in these
texts), imperatives, and verbs that are intransitive because the object was
incorporated.

Imperatives, of course, imply a second-person subject, which is rarely
overtly mentioned. Clauses with incorporated objects never appear with overt
NP subjects in these four texts. Incorporating the object serves to generalize
the activity denoted by the verb+object construction, de-emphasizing the
patient argument.
