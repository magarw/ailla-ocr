A maximal MIG Zoque verbal complex would consist of one member from
each of the position classes. Although the corpus does not contain any word in
which all the position slots are filled, there is no reason in principle why such a
word could not exist; indeed, there are surprisingly few co-occurence
restrictions among the classes or among specific members of the classes. One
of the most complete examples in the corpus is given below. In addition to the
obligatory person agreement marker (?əy+, position 2) and inflectional suffix (-
wǝ,10), this verb complex has a causative (yak-, 3), a directional prefix (win-,
4), compounded verb roots (ten=cəy, 5), the antipassive suffix (-7oy, 6), and a
post-inflectional clitic (+7am, 11).
