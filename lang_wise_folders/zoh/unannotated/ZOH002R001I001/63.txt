3.3.7. Glottal stop deletion
There are three contexts in which a glottal stop is deleted: (a) between
vowels; (b) syllable-finally before a C-initial syllable; and (c) word-finally before
another word (not utterance-finally).
The (a) case, intervocalic deletion, is shown in (3.11). The final /ǝ/ in (i)
first changes to an /a/ under the influence of the clitic syllable. Once the
glottal stop has deleted, the two like vowels contract, as described in (3.3.8).

The simple case for (b), syllable-final deletion, occurs when a glottal
stop-final root such as tə?-, 'to want' is followed by a consonant-initial
morpheme, like a plural suffix. Remember that there aren't very many vowel-
final morphemes in this language, and no vowel-final verb roots.
