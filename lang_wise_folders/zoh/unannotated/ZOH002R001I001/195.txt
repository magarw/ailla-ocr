Sometimes the translations of verb roots with perseverative suffixes
focussed on the moment of the actual event, especially roots indicating some
particular motion or position of the hands, or of moving things with sticks. In
all such cases, my consultants thought the perseverative forms were odd, but
willingly offered translations. The meanings of the suffixed forms were
generally "to have the hand or stick in the position of V-ing and not move it for
a little while".
