7.1.1.9. win
This morpheme was once an independent noun, as attested by a few
lexical items with nominal case endings and a few compounds (7.14 i and ii).
The gloss for this item is clearly 'surface' or 'front', although, as always, there
are many verbal constructions with no clearly compositional interpretation. The
gloss code for this morpheme is FACE. It sometimes co-occurs with the suffix
—?ay.
