Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Piwǝ? 'who' can be used to question any argument that
references a human being. In texts, it typically refers to the actor,
as shown in examples (12.2 i-ii). Example (iii) can be interpreted
two ways: ?iwa? can refer to either the giver or the recipient. In
example (iv) it refers to the patient argument. Examples (v-vi)
show that the question word can refer to an argument in a
subordinate clause. In (v), ?iwe? refers to the recipient of 'tell' and
in (vi) to the agent of 'close'.

2 This looks like an antipassive form with an expressed object (the daughter),
but the stem ci?.?oy- seems to be a lexicalized form meaning 'to give as a gift'.
It thus does not obey the normal rules for antipassive constructions.
