crush-IMPV 2E+ body+LOC2 all.X
'Crush it (tobacco leaves) all over your body.'
The related form hemhi?ok means 'all over'. All the examples that I have
of this word come from the interview with the healer, in which it always refers
to the body (example 9.18). This is the only occurrence of this .?ok morpheme
(not the same as the prefix DOWN) in MIG Zoque, but MAR Zoque has an affix
.?ok that means 'the end of beginning of a thing' (Kaufman, p.c.).

4 MAR Zoque has hate? (Kaufman, p.c.).

9.5.2. Quantifying clitics
+haa? (NPL2) has related functions: (a) plural-marking first and second
person discourse participants; (b) set distribution (an 'each' function); (c) and
creating plural forms of question words4. I am perhaps guilty of excessive
lumping by grouping these together in a single morpheme, rather than splitting
them into three phonologically identical ones, but there seems to be a
continuum of related function here.
