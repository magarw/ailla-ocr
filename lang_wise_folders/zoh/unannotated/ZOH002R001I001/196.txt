7.1.4. The mysterious yet ubiquitous suffix ?əy
This suffix usually appears with one of the directional prefixes discussed
in section 7.1.1. I have not been able to determine what it means or what its
function could be in the verbal complex. If it's a circumfix, why do the prefixes
that co-occur with it also freely occur without it? I tried to make a case for
collapsing this -?ǝy with the versive VERS2 that derives verbs from nouns, but
this did not hold up. There were too few cases in which the stem to which -?ǝy
was attached could be reasonably construed as nominal. It does not
consistently make intransitive roots transitive, or otherwise affect the argument
