Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
9.7. Coordination and comparison
Noun phrases or parts of noun phrases can be coordinated by means of
the Spanish conjunction y, 'and' (transcribed ?i in Zoque), or by simply
juxtaposing the conjoined elements. The Spanish conjunction method is the
most common.

Comparison in noun phrases, as in verb phrases, is done by means of the
Spanish comparative mas, 'more', and follows the Spanish syntactic pattern. I
find no hints in the corpus as to how this might have been done before the
invasion, but Suarez (1983:110) observes that in Tlahuitoltepec Mixe
"comparison of superiority is rendered by two clauses, one asserting the quality
for the item compared, the other negating it for the term of comparison". This
would produce phrases like "he is tall, I am not so tall".
