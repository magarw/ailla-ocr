Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
In this chapter we'll look at the various types of sentences that can be
composed of more than one clause. Relative clauses are discussed in section
11.1. In section 11.2, we look at coordinated clauses. Section 11.3 has a
discussion of comparative constructions. These are formed on the model of
Spanish grammar, using connectives borrowed from Spanish. We return to MIG
Zoque connectives in sections 11.4 and 11.5, to discuss purpose clauses and 'if'
clauses, respectively. Section 11.6 contains a discussion of clauses using
Spanish subordinators. In section 11.7, we look at 'that' clauses, which appear
with verbs of speaking, perceiving, and wanting. Section 11.8 contains a
description of locative clauses.
Chapter 11: Multi-clause Expressions
In general, MIG Zoque syntax does not entail requirements on the
referent of third person agreement markers in subordinate clauses. The
referents of subject or object agreement markers are determined pragmatically.
The following two examples illustrate this point.
