Relative clauses whose head nouns are the agents of a transitive verb are
very common, but they tend to be treated simply as noun phrases; that is, they
can be pluralized with the clitic +dəkkay, and they often appear as modifiers of
another noun (most commonly pǝn, 'man'). Many of these clauses are
lexicalized, especially those that identify some occupation, such as mayor,
teacher, or fisherman. The first examples in (11.7) are of this kind. The line
between stable lexicalization and productive morphology is impossible to draw
in a language like this one some examples that are probably not lexicalized
are shown in the later examples.
