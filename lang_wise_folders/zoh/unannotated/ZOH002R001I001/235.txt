Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
across something (since it has to do generally with spreading or scattering);
hence, it applies to the complex action denoted by both compound roots. In
(v), the actor ends up facing forward, the fundamental action conveyed by the
two verb stems. The causative is used because he does this deliberately - he
causes himself to face forward. The antipassive is added to defeat the
transitivity of the causative he's not causing someone else to face forward,
he's moving himself. Finally, in (vi), the repetitive suffix applies to the action of
killing a deer with a blow (it's the second deer). The jaguar doesn't repeatedly
swipe his paw at the deer to kill it.
