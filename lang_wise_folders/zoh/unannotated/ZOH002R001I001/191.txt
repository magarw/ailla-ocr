7.1.2.2. Depositive wey
The term depositive means "to place something that has the shape
created by V-ing it", or "Take X and put it" (Kaufman, 1996). This morpheme
never appears with other non-inflectional suffixes. The initial /w/ of this suffix
triggers gemination of the preceding consonant just like the completive suffix -
wǝ. This means that there are many cases in which it is difficult to determine
whether we're looking at -way or -7ay. In these cases, only the meaning
provides a clue to the underlying construction. Even allowing for possible mis-
parses, there are very few depositive forms in the corpus. The following
examples, except for (7.18 v), are taken from the lexicon.
