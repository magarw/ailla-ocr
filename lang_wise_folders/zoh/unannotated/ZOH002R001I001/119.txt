Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimapala Zoque
there is nothing for the clitic to lean against, and thus no preceding form to
merge with phonologically.
The reduced forms are clearly clitics, satisfying most of the tests for
clitic-hood discussed in Zwicky (1985) and in Zwicky and Pullum (1983). They
"exhibit a low degree of selection with respect to their hosts" (Zwicky and
Pullum, 1983:503); indeed, they attach to whatever element is to the left of the
verb complex. All MIG Zoque clitics lean to the left, clearly evidenced by pauses
of some length between the host+clitic and the rest of the verbal complex in
some of the texts. Person agreement clitics appear in the corpus attached to
Zoque negatives, the volitive yakkə, auxiliary verbs, and Spanish function words
like para, que and si
