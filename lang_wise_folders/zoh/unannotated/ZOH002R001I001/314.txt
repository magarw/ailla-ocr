11.9. 'That' clauses: verbs of speaking, perception and cognition
The Zoque ke, 'that', is borrowed from the Spanish que. It appears
between the two clauses that it conjoins. Examples i and ii in this section were
elicited.
11.9.1 Speaking
There are three verb roots for acts of speaking in MIG Zoque: nəm-, 'to
say'; ?otoŋ-, 'to speak'; and cam-, 'to chat; to converse; to tell'. There are also
many derived forms, such as ho.nəm- (INTO.say), 'to translate'. ?otoŋ- is an
intransitive root that is rarely accompanied by a report of what was said. One
example of its use is given in (11.23 i). cam- (ii) means to converse together,
or more commonly, to tell a story. It is also not used to introduce reported
speech.
nəm- is the root that's used for reporting speech, and it is ubiquitous in
the corpus. The preferred syntax is: nəm- Speaker Speech. If it is introducing
dialog (iii-iv), no connective or special
or special marker is used. The Spanish
complementizer ke (que, 'that') is used to present indirect quotes (v-vi).
