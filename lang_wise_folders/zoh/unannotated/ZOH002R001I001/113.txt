4.11. Modals
Modals affect the mood or aspectual interpretation of the clause in which
they appear. The complete set is shown in table 4.8. geta and mo? are used
only in questions, and they are discussed further in chapter 12. They appear
after the question word, but not necessarily immediately after, as shown in
example (4.35 i). The other modals are discussed in chapter 13. bəšə and
pinək exhibit considerable freedom with respect to position, often appearing at
the beginning of the clause, as shown in example (ii).
