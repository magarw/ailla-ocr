It has been noted that the single argument of an intransitive verb may be
either an actor or an undergoer, and that there is no formal way to distinguish
unaccusative intransitive verb roots from unergative ones in MIG Zoque. So,
there are many verb roots and stems for which it is not possible to determine if
the sole argument is an actor or an undergoer.

Locations are rather a special case in MIG Zoque. They do appear in
clauses unmarked by a locative postposition or adverb, particularly when the NP
is a proper noun. It isn't reasonable to include location in the undergoer
macrorole, however, because there is always a patient or theme at least implied
