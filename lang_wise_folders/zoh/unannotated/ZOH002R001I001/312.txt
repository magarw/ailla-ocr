The Spanish word hora, 'hour', has also been borrowed as a MIG Zoque
subordinator. It appears immediately after the verb complex, syntactically
parallel to the relative and locative clitic subordinators. This one isn't a clitic,
since if it were the initial syllable would contract with the final syllable of the
preceding word. I believe this is the only case in MIG Zoque of a borrowed
Spanish function word being used in accordance with the Zoque syntax, rather
than importing the Spanish syntax along with the word 2.

'In fact when he jumped on top of him he knocked him over there.'

2 Terrence Kaufman points out that the Zapotec of Juchitán also uses hora in this way, but it is
a right-branching construction in that language.
