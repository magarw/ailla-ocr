There are only three examples of SOV clauses in this sub-corpus. Two of
them appear in 'Satornino and the Soldiers', where I believe Sr. Sánchez is again
fronting the object NPs for rhetorical effect. It appears to be part of his
performance of the pompous style of speech adopted by the two authority
figures in the story, the mayor and the lieutenant. The example in (14.15)
occurs during the lieutenant's retelling of the main events of the story. Note
that the object NP is repeated after the verb as well.

There are only four VSO clauses in this set of texts. Three of them are
verbs of speaking or seeing, illustrated in (14.16 i). The other is part of the
most dramatic section of 'Satornino and the Soldiers', and I assume this unusual
order was used to heighten the excitement of the scene. (This is the scene in
which the soldiers repeatedly miss their targets, with mounting frustration on
the part of the lieutenant.)
