14.2.3. Transitive clauses
Transitive clauses allow two arguments: an agent and a patient. There
are also some verb roots, like ci?-, 'to give', that allow a third argument (a
recipient), and several valency-increasing affixes that add
add a recipient,
benefactor, or causer. Since the overt mention of any third argument is
extremely rare (0.7% of transitive clauses), I counted trivalent clauses in with
the simple transitives.
Table 14.4 shows the distribution of overt NPs in transitive clauses. The
percentage given refers to the total number of transitive clauses. The term
Dative subsumes all the roles of the third argument - recipient, benefactor, etc.
In imperative clauses the subject is known to be the second person, so these
are counted separately.
