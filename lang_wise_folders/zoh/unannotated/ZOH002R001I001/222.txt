V2 determines the valency of the whole construction. Affixes that affect
argument structure will thus appear only on V2. Actually, the causative is the
only valency-changing affix that could potentially apply to any of the
auxiliaries, since they are generally intransitive in their independent forms².
The causative usually affects only the semantic structure of V2, as shown in
examples (8.6 i) – 'you go to cause it to be filled' - and (ii) - 'they went to cause
him to see'. But a causative on V2 can apply to the whole auxiliary
construction, as in (iii) – 'he caused him to come speak Zoque'.

muš- 'to know' is the only exception, but its meaning and argument structure are slightly
different in the auxiliary form - 'to know how to V2' - so it wouldn't accept the antipassive or
passive suffixes anyway.
