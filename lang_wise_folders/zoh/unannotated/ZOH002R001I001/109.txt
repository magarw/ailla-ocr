4.9. Intensifiers
There are three intensifiers in MIG Zoque: wenu (we:n), bayun (ban) and
hakke (hak). These are frequently shortened to the forms given in parentheses.
They all mean the same thing - 'very; a lot'. All three intensifiers can modify
either verbs or adjectives. The corpus shows a preference for hakke with verbs
and ban with adjectives; wenu is considerably rarer. The examples in (4.32)
were taken from the lexicon or elicited.
