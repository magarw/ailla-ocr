The volitive morpheme yakkə precedes the person agreement markers
and is accompanied by the imperative suffix. yakkǝ is often shortened in
context to yak, in which case it can be confused with the causative yak-, except
that the causative prefix is rarely in a position to receive even secondary stress,
and the first syllable of yakkə always receives stress even when the second
syllable is lost.

The volitive is "a designation of the verbal form or mood used in
expressing an intention, wish, etc." (Pei and Gaynor, 1954). This form is used
in MIG Zoque to express polite or indirect requests, and to express a wish or
expectation that something should (possibly soon) happen.
