In keeping with its character as an almost-auxiliary verb, wit-, 'to walk',
appears frequently in verb compounds to indicate motion, but with no
particular direction specified. It generally appears with verbs of carrying, as
shown in examples (8.23 i-ii), but also with other sorts of verbs, where it
means 'going around V1-ing' (iii).
