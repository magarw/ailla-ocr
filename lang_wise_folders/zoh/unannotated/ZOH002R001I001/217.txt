Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chapter 8: Dependent Verb Constructions
In MIG Zoque, one verb root can be dependent on another in two ways:
morphologically or syntactically. Morphological dependency obtains when two
verb stems are compounded in a single verb complex. These constructions are
the most varied, and so are discussed last, in section 8.3.
Syntactically dependent verb constructions consist of a sequence of two
verb complexes in which the second (V2) is dependent on the first (V1). V1 is
inflected for aspect or mood as it would be if it were the only verb in the clause,
using one of the eight aspect/mood suffixes shown in Table 5.2. V2 is
inflected with one of the two dependent suffixes: -E if V1 has completive
aspect, and -wə if it is in the incompletive or a non-declarative mood. Only V2
is marked for agreement with the subject (and object), and the agreement
marker is always selected from the ergative set, regardless of V2's transitivity.
The whole construction has only one argument structure.

The auxiliary verbs defined in section 4.1.5. can appear in a dependent
construction with any other verb (pace pragmatic obstacles, as in, for instance,
'the mangoes hurried to rot'). A complete description of auxiliary verb
constructions is given in section 8.1. Other dependent verb constructions are
generally translated 'to V1 while V2-ing' (as in example 8.1), and are more
