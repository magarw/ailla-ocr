Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
features from the agent argument: the thing was done, obviously someone did
it, but we have no idea who. Typologically, this is the most common kind of
passive in the world's languages (Shibatani, 1986). The passive suffix creates
an intransitive verb from a transitive one, so the person agreement markers
appear in the absolutive case.
I found slight variations in the translation of passive expressions with
different consultants. Some preferred an indefinite, but human, agent reading
("someone broke it" or "they broke it"), while others insisted on a perfectly
agentless, middle voice reading ("It got broken, we don't know how.") In either
case, there is never an actual agent argument lurking around to be referenced
by a subsequent clause, such as a conjoined clause.
