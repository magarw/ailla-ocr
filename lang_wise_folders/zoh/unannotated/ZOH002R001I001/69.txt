Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
I found only two exceptions to this rule in my corpus, shown in (3.19 i-ii).
It should be noted that a /w/ occurring in the position in which this rule
regularly applies is a rather subtle sound it is quite possible that I simply
heard these examples wrong, or that the glide was the result of the emphasis
sometimes employed in citation speech. The rule does not apply to /w/ in
syllable-initial position4, as can be seen in example (3.19 iii).
(3.19)

(iii)

'øy jowanpa

1E+ INTO.sing-INC
'I'm reading.'
There are four monomorphemic lexical items in the corpus that contain
vowel sequences from between which a /w/ might have been deleted at an
earlier stage of the language. Again, the second vowel in these words is
strongly laryngealized.
joa'
hoa?
'deep'

poa?

There are no syllables in MIG Zoque with contiguous /y/ and /i/. There are verb roots
that begin with /ye/, such as yem-, 'to fan', but none of these happen to appear in the corpus
with the vowel-final prefixes ni- (PSE), ho- (INTO), or ko- (SOC).
