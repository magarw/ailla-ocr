Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Pora, (hora, 'hour') has been partially grammaticalized as a temporal
relative, parallel to the locative relative +hi?. It thus sometimes appears in the
Zoque subordinator position, immediately after the verb complex, as shown in
example (4.34 i). It is also used in the expression la ?ora ke (la hora que, 'the
hour that') in the Spanish subordinator position at the beginning of the clause,
as shown in example (ii). The common term for introducing a when clause is
kwando (cuando, 'when'), is shown in example (iii).
