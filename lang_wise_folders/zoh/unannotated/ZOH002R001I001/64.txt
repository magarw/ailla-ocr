Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
morpheme-initial glottal stop fails to delete, it serves as evidence that the
preceding morpheme does indeed end in a glottal stop. This is a useful
diagnostic for determining the underlying shape of glottal stop-final verb roots,
like tə?-, 'to want', whose final consonant generally disappears in context.

The more interesting case appears when a vowel-initial suffix (see 3.3.2)
attaches to a stem in the shape CV?C. The word is re-syllabified so that the
final C of the stem's coda becomes the onset of the suffix syllable. This leaves
the glottal stop in syllable-final position, from which it is deleted.
