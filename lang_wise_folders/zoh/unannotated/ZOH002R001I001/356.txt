Progressive viewpoint is a subset of the incompletive viewpoint, which
can also be used to present a situation that is ongoing. The progressive,
however, cannot be used for future or habitual situations. The overlapping
reference of the two viewpoints is illustrated by the following pair of examples.
In this text, a fisherman comes upon a group of boys who are beating a sea
turtle with clubs, to make it lay its eggs. (The fisherman saves the turtle who
turns out to be magical and grants him his every wish.)
