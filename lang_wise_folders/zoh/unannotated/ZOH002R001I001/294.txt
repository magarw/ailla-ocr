Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
11.1.1. Basic relative clauses
This is most common and most general form of relative clause. This type
is marked by a clitic that attaches to the right edge of the verb complex. As
noted in section 9.3, there are two forms of this clitic: +V?k and +p…ô?k. The
first form appears with vowel-final words and the second with consonant-final
words. Since most verb complexes end in vowels (because the inflectional
suffixes are all vowel-final), the examples in this section will generally show the
+V?k form. The clitic syllable contracts with the preceding syllable, producing a
stressed final syllable. The final stress on relative clauses is usually highly
salient, and in emphatic or especially careful speech, the final /?k/ can be
heard.
The head noun always precedes the SREL verb complex, and there may be
other arguments or adverbs between it and the verb. There is no relative
pronoun in MIG Zoque, nor are personal pronouns or deictics used to delimit
the relative clause. Since word order is restricted in relative clauses, whereas it
is free in the general case, it seems reasonable to refer to MIG Zoque relative
clauses as externally-headed. Subjects and objects are marked on both the
matrix and subordinate verbs by the person agreement markers, and the head
noun of the relative clause is simply construed with both of them.
There are no restrictions on which of the verb's arguments can be
relativized. Similarly, any argument in the matrix clauses can be modified by a
relative clause. In the vast majority of the examples in the texts, NPREL is the SREL
patient (11.3), but there are a few with actors (11.4). I was able to elicit
sentences with relativized recipients (11.5 i, ii), sources (iii), possessed nouns
