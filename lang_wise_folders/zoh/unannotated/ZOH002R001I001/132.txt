5.6. Marking of dependent verbs in auxiliary verb constructions
The second verb in an auxiliary + verb construction is referred to as the
dependent verb. In these constructions, the auxiliary appears first, inflected for
aspect but not preceded by the expected person agreement markers. These
appear between the auxiliary and the dependent verb, which is then marked
with -we, (dINC) for the incompletive, or with -E (dCOM) for the completive.
The dependent incompletive suffix is also used with the imperative, volitive,
and exhortative moods. Dependent verb constructions are discussed further in
chapter 8.
