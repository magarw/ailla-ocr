(i)
The incorporated argument is most commonly the patient, in which case
the verb complex is made intransitive and marked with one of the absolutive
agreement markers. The incorporated noun does not function as a classifier, as
in classificatory NI (Mithun, 1984), so no additional, more-specific noun may
appear in the role of patient. Incorporated patients are non-specific: you can
say "I was tree-cutting", but not "I was that-tree-cutting" with reference to a
particular tree.
