The most common form of manner modification expressed by verb
compounds is 'to V2 by V1-ing'. Since I think it's been well-established that
transitive verbs can appear in the V2 slot, I can shift the focus of this section to
the variety of functions performed by the first verb in a compound construction.
The remainder of the examples in this section will include both transitive and
intransitive verbs in either position. The last two examples in (8.30) illustrate
the sub-genre 'to die or kill by V1-ing'.
