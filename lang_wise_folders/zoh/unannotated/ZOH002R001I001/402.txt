The neutral dey is also used to refer to the recent past in dialog, where it
necessarily refers to the time of the story, rather than the time of narration. In
the following pair of examples, gay places the event in the remote past - the
time when the little jaguar finally meets the two-legged one. In the subsequent
bits of dialog, dey refers to the immediate past (ii) and the immediate future
(iii), nicely illustrating the flexibility of the neutral deictic. I'm not sure why he
doesn't use yey, the proximal form, in (iii): perhaps because the jaguar doesn't,
in fact, eat the man?
