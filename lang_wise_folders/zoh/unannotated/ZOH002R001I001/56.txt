Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
3.3.2. Vowel harmony
There are five vowel-initial suffixes in MIG Zoque:
1.
result noun -a/-ə (~ -a?/-ə?);
2.
participle -i/-e (~ -i?/-e?);
3.
indefinite -anəm/-ənəm;
4.
imperative -a?/-ǝ?;
5.
reciprocal -ǝ/-a.
Each has two basic alternations, in which the choice of vowel depends on
the height of the preceding vowel. // must be classified as a high vowel for
this system, although phonetically it is a mid vowel. The 'sixth vowel' in the
other Mixe-Zoquean languages is the high central vowel /ü/; the MIG Zoque
vowel harmony system conforms with that inventory. So, the set of high vowels
for these rules is {/i/, /u/, /ə/}. The mid vowels are {/e/, /o/}. The set of non-
mid vowels is {/i/, /u/, /ə/, /a/}.
There are two rules:
(1) ə
(2) e-
-> a / V[mid] C __
-> i i
/ V[high] C __.
The morpheme breakdowns in data examples use the symbol A to
indicate a vowel that appears on the surface as /a/ or /ə/; the underlying vowel
is /ǝ/. For example, the imperative is represented as -A?. The following
examples illustrate the operation of rule (1).
