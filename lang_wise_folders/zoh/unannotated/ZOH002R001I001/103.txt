Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
4.8. Adverbs
Adverbs are words that indicate time, direction, or location. (There also
are a very few words that express manner, such as ponhi, 'softly; slowly'.) Their
semantic function is thus similar to that of the postpositions, but syntactically
their behavior is different. These elements are words, not clitics, and are thus
not constrained to follow immediately after a noun.
4.8.1. Direction and location adverbs
MIG Zoque has sets of adverbs relating a figure to a ground in a common
pattern: above, below, in front of and behind. There are also a few adverbs
referring to position on a slope, and three adverbs that are only used to refer to
locations in the town of San Miguel.
