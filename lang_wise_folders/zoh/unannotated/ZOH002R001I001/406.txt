The marker pwes, 'well', ubiquitous in Mexican speech, most commonly
appears in MIG Zoque texts in dialog. An example of this is shown in (14.27 i),
from a portion of the story in which the leader is rallying the men to go and
fight the rebels. This is a normal, garden-variety use of the marker. pwes also
appears in non-dialog portions of texts to signal a description of the internal
state of a character. Example (ii) is from 'Satornino and the Soldiers'. Here, the
soldiers have just tried to shoot the monkeys four times and failed each time.
This passage is spoken very rapidly, all in one breath, expressing the intense
frustration of the lieutenant.
