The exclusive forms are the ones that are in general use. The exclusive
plural dəšhá? appears abundantly in texts, in any context involving the speaker
and someone else. The inclusive forms are rarely used, except for ney, which is
the form most commonly used to mean 'our'. There are no cases in which the
contrast between exclusive and inclusive plural is deliberately exploited. There
are two texts in which the inclusive forms appear frequently, both exhortations
made by Sr. Sánchez to his fellow Zoques (on tape, not in person) to preserve
and remember the ways of their ancestors. Examples from this text are shown
in (4.16).
