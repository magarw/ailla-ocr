There are three spatial adverbs that refer only to directions or locations in
San Miguel Chimalapa. The river Espíritu Santo runs from north to south,
downhill from the Chimalapa wilderness. The road to Santa María Chimalapa
begins at the northernmost, uppermost edge of town, and the road to Juchitán
begins at the southernmost, lowest edge of town. Uphill towards Santa María
can be indicated with k?š?na?, and downhill can be indicated by ?okhona?.
These terms only apply within the town if you want to say 'up into the
mountains', you have to use another term. The third term, gaha?k wintu?k,
'across the river', refers only to the neighborhood on the other side of the
Espíritu Santo river from the main part of town (where the church is).
The indicates a verb root that never appears independently (without some derivational
affixes) in the modern MIG Zoque lexicon. So, for example, you can't say də maŋpa, 'I will
step'. Many of these roots, like maŋ-, appear so frequently in derived stems that it is possible
to deduce their meaning and provide a gloss, but the * is used to remind us that this gloss is
my guess, and not a native speaker translation.
