Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
frequently in the corpus, always immediately after a noun phrase, and never
appear independently. +ho? is the only unstressed monosyllabic form in the
set. When it is postposed to a noun, stress appears on the final syllable of that
noun: kócək => kocákho?.
The indeterminacy between these two word classes is certainly not unique
to MIG Zoque - the English word 'down' exhibits the same behavior. Generally,
if a word appears in an independent position even once, I class it with the
adverbs, and if most of the words based on a root morpheme (like cap) are
adverbs, I put the rest of the similarly-based lexemes in the adverb class, too.
The exception to this algorithm are the four stress-altering ?aŋ- lexemes
mentioned above.
