Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chapter 12: Questions
There are three types of questions in MIG Zoque that will be
discussed in this chapter: yes-no questions (section 12.1),
question-word or information questions (section 12.2), and indirect
questions (section 12.3). There is also a small set of modals that
apply only to questions, which are discussed in section 12.4.
12.1. Yes-no questions
Yes-no questions are marked by rising intonation, with no
special markers or changes in word order. The first example in
(12.1 i) is a common morning greeting amongst intimates¹. In
texts, yes-no questions usually occur within bits of dialog, and are
introduced with a word that means 'to ask' (example ii). Example
(iii) illustrates the syntactic identity between a yes-no question and
a declarative statement. The line spoken by Sr.Germán Sánchez
Morales has rising question intonation, while the answer spoken by
Sr. Omobono Sánchez Miguel (the curandero) has falling declarative
intonation: otherwise, the two expressions are identical.
A common greeting in public is 'hum nəkpa?' ('Where are you going?').
Conventional responses are (in Spanish) 'a un mandado' ('on an errand') or
'gahanan' ('over there').
