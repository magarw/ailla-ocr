Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Zoque forms and the Spanish forms. It is common to find them both together
in single clause, with the Spanish morphemes on the left and the Zoque ones on
the right. The infiltration of Spanish function words is a characteristic of many
Mesoamerican languages (Thompson & Longacre, 1985; Kaufman & Thomason,
1988).

Relative clauses are ubiquitous in MIG Zoque narratives, bearing most of
the burden of description or elaboration of discourse entities. For convenience,
I'll refer to the relative clause as SREL, and use the term head noun to refer to the
noun phrase being modified by SREL. When I need to distinguish the head noun
in its capacity as an argument of the SREL, I'll call it the NPREL (following Keenan,
1985). There are two ways to form a relative clause, by attaching a clitic marker
to the end of the SREL verb complex (section 11.1.1.), or by simply heading the
SREL with the definite article bi (section 11.1.2). The second method is used only
for clauses of the general form Pronoun (is) bi Srel (That is the one that S...).
