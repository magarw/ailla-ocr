Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
4.2. Nouns
Nouns are those words that can appear with the definite article bi, or
similarly, with one of the deictics. This is not strictly a root class, since there
are many derivational suffixes that form nouns from verb roots or from
adjectives (section 7.2). Noun compounding is common, although it can be
difficult to determine whether the result is a word or a phrase (section 9.4).
Relative clauses may also be headed by the definite article (section 11.1), in
which case they are functioning simply as nouns.

(ZOH001R015-021)
There is no set of nouns in MIG Zoque that is obligatorily possessed, as is
the case in some MesoAmerican languages (Suarez, 1983). There are no nouns
for which possession is ungrammatical, although certainly some such
collocations are pragmatically absurd (?ən ?inə?, 'my cloud', for example).
