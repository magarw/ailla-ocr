Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Transitive clauses with both subject and object NPs are quite rare only
4.1% of all transitive clauses. Table 14.7 shows the relative frequency of the
possible orderings of these NPs with respect to the verb8.

Table 14.7: Transitive clauses with both subject and object NPs
SVO order is the most frequent in this category, with 61.1% of transitive
clauses with both subject and object NPs appearing in this order. It is
reasonable to suppose that the preference for SV order when only subject NPs
appear and VO order when there is only an object NP is a reflection of this same
preferred pattern. Again, in many of these the subject NP is a pronoun, as
shown in (14.14 i). Example (ii) is the climax of 'The Two-Legged One', when
the little jaguar finally has his showdown with the hunter, who shoots him
fatally.

8 Technically, it is grammatical for object NPs to precede subjects when there is no possibility
of confusing the roles, such as when the object is inanimate and the verb requires an animate
agent. I elicited positive grammaticality judgements for examples of this kind (see Appendix F),
but they don't seem to appear in the texts. (I haven't made an exhaustive search for them.)
