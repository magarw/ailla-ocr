Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
(ii)
It isn't always possible to tell if the single argument of an unaccusative
verb has been incorporated or not, since the third person absolutive marker is
0. One way of testing this is to make the expression negative, in which case the
incorporated noun will appear inside the negative marker (10.5 i). In example
(ii), phonological evidence suggests that the noun hama 'day' has been
incorporated, because it has been shortened to a single syllable. Examples (iv)
and (v) may or may not be incorporation constructions, thought it seems likely
that they are, especially (iv) which is probably lexicalized.
