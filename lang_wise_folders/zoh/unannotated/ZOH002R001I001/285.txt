(v)
(10.6)
(i)
The incorporated noun phrase can be modified by elements external to
the verb complex; that is, modifiers may be stranded. These must be non-
specific sorts of modifiers, such as relative clauses. The examples in (10.6)
illustrate the contrast between modification of an incorporated noun (i) and of
an unincorporated noun (ii). Notice that in (i) the modifying adjective has been
relativized: "He builds houses that are big."
(ii)
'axta ke tømtukpa
Pašta ke təm=tuk-pa

Non-existential relative clauses are also allowed as stranded modifiers
(10.7 i-v). These can be full clauses, with no restrictions on mood, polarity,
valency, etc.
