Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
completive and incompletive inflectional suffixes can be used with any type of
verb. There are also two syntactic constructions for forming the perfect and the
progressive.
13.1.1. Completive
Completive aspect "present[s] a situation as a single whole" (Smith,
1991:103), including both endpoints of a situation. Verbs with completive
aspect are consistently translated with the Spanish preterite tense. The
completive is the most usual choice in narrative texts; since it presents the
endpoint of a situation, it is used to move the events of the story forward in
time.
