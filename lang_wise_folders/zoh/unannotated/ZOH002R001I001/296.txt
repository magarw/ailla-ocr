The last example has a postposition marking the entire relative clause as
an accompaniment (oblique) phrase. These elicited examples are the only ones
of their kind in the corpus, so although they are acceptable, they are certainly
not commonly used. When I tried to elicit instrumental relative clauses, I got
mixed judgements. Sr. Miguel considered the first example shown in (11.6)
grammatical, but Sr. Sánchez hated it, and offered example (ii) in its place¹. My
conclusion is that relativizing oblique arguments of verbs is at best a rare and
at worst a marginal construction in this language.
¹ Note that this example includes an incorporated instrument noun, another very unusual
construction (see chapter 10 for further discussion of noun incorporation).
