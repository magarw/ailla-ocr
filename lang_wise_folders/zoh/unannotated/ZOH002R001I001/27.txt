Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
verbs (Himes, 1997) and a dissertation on Oluta Popoluca, a Mixean language
(Zavala, forthcoming).
Dictionaries of MZ languages (and several Zapotecan languages) are
on-line
published
by
the
project
at
http://www.albany.edu/anthro/maldp/. There are currently two: the San
Miguel Chimalapa Zoque Lexicon (Johnson and Kaufman, 1997), and the Oluta
Popoluca Lexicon (Zavala, 1997). A third, the Santa María Chimalapa Zoque
Lexicon, by Terrence Kaufman, will be placed on-line this year.
These are
searchable databases, originally developed as Shoebox databases (Davis &
Wimbish, 1993). The plan is to publish analyzed texts as well as lexicons over
the course of the next five years. Information on the structure of the M
Zoque lexicon is provided in Appendix A.
Wichman (1993) is an excellent survey of both the demographic situation
in Mixe and Zoque communities and of the literature on all Mixe-Zoquean
languages. He mentions the following as containing some MIG Zoque data:
Spear, 1872; Cerda Silva, 1941; Cordry & Cordry, 1941; Cruz Lorenzo, 1987.
Cruz Lorenzo is a Zoque from San Miguel Chimalapa who has also written a
primer for schoolchildren that contains some vocabulary and a few short texts
(Cruz Lorenzo, 1981). He is revising his grammar of the language for
publication in the near future. In my analysis of MIG Zoque verbal morphology,
I made use of Wonderley's analysis of the verbal morphology of Copainalá
Chiapas Zoque (Wonderley, 1951-2). For the most part, however, my principal
resource on MZ lanaguages in general and Oaxacan Zoque in particular has
been the vast knowledge of Terrence Kaufman, which I refer to somewhat
inadequately as (Kaufman, 1996), indicating the collection of notes and
handouts and other materials distributed to the MALDP participants.
