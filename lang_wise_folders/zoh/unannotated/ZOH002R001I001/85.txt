Ney participates in many pronominal constructions with various sorts of
endings, suffixes or other pronouns2. (Note that when two nouns or pronouns
are juxtaposed in the speech stream, there is no phonological evidence, such as
stress, to indicate whether or not the two are compounded or simply
neighboring forms. The simplest assumption is that they are two distinct
words.) Table 4.2 lists all the ney collocations with their English and Spanish
translations. Semantically, they fall into three groups: first person plurals,
reflexives, and 'some (thing/one/time)' words. These are not necessarily all
cases of the same morpheme, but reflect different stages of the development of
MIG Zoque (Kaufman, p.c.). The original meaning is 'self', still apparent in the
reciprocal morpheme. The meaning shifted to 'same' in a variety of uses. The
first person plural sense of ney is a relatively recent innovation of MIG Zoque.

Kaufman proposes that ney should be considered a clitic or affix that occupies a
position immediately to the right of the person agreement markers. I only have one example of
ney with an agreement marker (4.14 ii), and none with the negative ya or causative yak, so I'm
unable to determine conclusively how it might relate to these neighboring elements. In the
example, the absolutive first person agreement marker appears because this is an inverse
construction (section 6.2.2).
