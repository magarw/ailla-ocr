Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
13.1.6.3. Verb compounds
Super-lexical morphemes "modulate the focus of a situation rather than
determining the situation itself" (Smith, 1991:76). In MIG Zoque, super-lexicals
that focus on one of the endpoints of a situation are verb stems used in
compound verb constructions.
Two of these stems focus the initial endpoint of a situation: ?okmaŋ- 6'to
begin to V' and tək.?əy- 'to enter into V-ing'. ?okmaŋ- can be used with any
verb, but tək.?əy- has a directional sense as well, and so really means 'to go in
somewhere and start V-ing'.

6 7ok.maŋ is a derived stem: DOWN.*step. I treat it as a single form because the compositional
semantics are not obvious, unless you can remember that one generally starts a journey from
San Miguel Chimalapa by going down from the mountains.
