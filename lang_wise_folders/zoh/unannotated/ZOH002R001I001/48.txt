Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Function words that do have MIG Zoque equivalents are also common in
the texts, such as the pronoun ?otro, otro, 'other' (MIG Zoque ?ey√°?k), the
subordinator si, si, 'if' (MIG Zoque bi?t), and relative pronoun ke, que, 'that'
(MIG Zoque +V?k, REL) which appears at the start of the relative clause, as
opposed to the MIG Zoque clitic which attaches to the end of the relative
clause's verb complex. This sort of borrowed function word frequently appears
in tandem with the native form, with the Spanish word on the left and the Zoque
morpheme on the right. This behavior is discussed in chapter 11, where
examples are given of expressions with just the MIG Zoque subordinator, just
the Spanish subordinator, and both forms together in one clause.
