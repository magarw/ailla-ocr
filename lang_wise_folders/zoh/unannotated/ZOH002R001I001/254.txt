'They saw her go inside.'
Finally, in compounds with ko.coŋ-, 'to help', as the V2 component, VI
can be a transitive verb with its own patient argument. The helper and the
helpee (agent and patient of ko.coŋ-) are both the agents of the V1 event.
These two constructions see+V2 and V1 +help are extreme examples of
core junctures, in which the two verbs do share an argument, but that argument
fills a different role for each verb.
