Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
It should be noted that only the first three Zoque numbers are commonly
heard; for larger figures, Spanish is invariably used. It is something of an
accomplishment these days to be able to count to ten in Zoque, and it was a
major feat for Sr. Sánchez to summon up the complete system for us from the
depths of his memory.
4.5. Adjectives
Adjectives specify a quality or dimension of the nouns that they modify.
Physical description is rare in MIG Zoque texts, so they appear but seldom.
There are about 45 adjectives in the dictionary, with the following sorts of
meanings: quantity, dimensions/directions, physical characteristics, personal
characteristics, and colors. Representatives from each set are shown below,
along with all five color words. (The color terms in Zoque conform perfectly
with the hierarchy of color terms defined in Berlin and Kay, 1969.)
