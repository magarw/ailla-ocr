None of the languages in the MZ family is well-documented, although
that situation is being rectified by participants in the MesoAmerican Languages
Documentation Project (MALDP), led by Terrence Kaufman and John Justeson.
This project began in 1993, with the initial goal of gathering lexical data for the
MZ languages to aid in the decipherment of Epi-Olmec (a Zoquean language)
inscriptions (Kaufman & Justeson, 1993). The current work is an outgrowth of
that project, in which I participated in the summers of 1994 and 1995. Other
work produced by project participants includes a thesis on Sierra Popoluca
