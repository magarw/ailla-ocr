Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
MIG Zoque clauses can have a third core argument. Verb roots whose
meaning involves some kind of exchange, such as ci?-, 'give', specify a recipient
role. The applicative suffix -hay (APPL) adds a recipient, benefactor, or location
role. The prefix ko- (SOC) also sometimes adds a benefactor. The causative
prefix yak- (CAUS) adds a causee role (since the causer is the actor in the
clause). It is possible for a verb stem with both the causative prefix and the
applicative suffix to have four core arguments. Although no such examples
with transitive verbs occurred in the texts, my consultants assured me that they
were perfectly acceptable and understandable. In example (6.6 iv), the
agreement marker miš (2>1) references the second person as the agent
(causer), while the first person is the recipient, an argument added by the
applicative suffix.
