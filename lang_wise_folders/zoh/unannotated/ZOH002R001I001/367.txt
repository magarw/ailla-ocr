13.2.1. Imperative
This is a simple second person imperative, marked by the suffix -A?
(IMPV). It applies to all types of verb roots, apart from pragmatic constraints
(you can't order it to rain, for example). It appears frequently in dialogs in the
texts, where it is used between peers or family members, or from a superior to
a subordinate.
