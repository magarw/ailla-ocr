7.2.3. Measure nouns
This is another suffix with alternate forms: -naaŋ/-neeŋ. The latter form
is relatively rare and does not appear to be phonologically conditioned, since -
naaŋ appears with verb stems containing all of the six possible vowels. In
accordance with the regular rule of syllable contraction (section 3.3.8), the
suffix receives primary stress even though it is the last syllable in the word.
This suffix is probably cognate with a suffix in neighboring MAR Zoque -i?iŋ/-
eleŋ, which creates a unit of measure or unitary event (Kaufman, p.c.).
1 MAR Zoque has a nearly-homophonous prefix ni?-, which means `VERB on it, esp. someone's
body'. Both prefixes co-occur with the suffix -?ǝy. (Kaufman, p.c.). We commonly find that
final glottal stops in MAR Zoque have been deleted in the MIG Zoque dialect. This ni?- prefix,
however, most closely corresponds semantically with the MIG Zoque prefix nik-, discussed in
section 7.1.1.8.
