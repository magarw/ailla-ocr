Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
2.3. The Spanish invasion and Zoque grammar
The Spanish invasion of Mexico began in 1519. The Oaxacan Zoques
were isolated in their vast, high, Chimalapan wilderness, and perhaps suffered
less intrusion than lowland groups of indigenous people. However, every level
of Zoque grammar has been affected by contact with Spanish to some degree.
Borrowing from Spanish into Zoque appears to range from category (2) to
category (3), on the borrowing scale of Thomason and Kaufman (1988:74-75).
Content words, of course, have been and continue to be borrowed freely. A
contrast between an early and later borrowing can be seen in the words for
'cattle', animals that were not known in MesoAmerica before the Spanish
brought them. One consultant had given us the word ganadu, which is simply
Spanish ganado with the final vowel raised (a regular rule of transforming a
Spanish word into a Zoque one). Sr. Sánchez objected to this word as being
just Spanish again, and offered us a Zoque word: wakaš. This is clearly the
Spanish vacas (note the plural ending), which was doubtless borrowed long
before the reach of even Sr. Sánchez's capacious memory, and completely
converted to Zoque phonology. Note that both words can be used as either
singular or plural forms, whereas in Spanish ganado is a mass noun - 'cattle' -
and vaca is a count noun - 'cow'.
