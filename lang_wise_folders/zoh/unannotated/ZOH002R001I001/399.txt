14.3. Discourse markers
Schiffrin (1987) defines discourse markers as "sequentially dependent
elements that bracket units of talk", which can be understand as including
whole narrative texts, as well as bits of dialog inside such texts. MIG Zoque
discourse markers can be divided into three sub-classes: sequencing terms,
which are mostly variants of 'then' or 'thence'; markers that appear only in
dialog; and narrative beginners and enders. These sets are shown in table 14.8.
This section will look at each of the sub-classes in turn, attempting to
distinguish among their members and to provide a general characterization of
their use in narrative. There is some overlap among the classes; for example,
bweno is both a narration beginner and a turn-taking marker in dialog. There
is also some individual variation in the choice of markers, particularly from the
many members of the sequencing set; for example, Sr. Omobono Sánchez
Miguel is the only speaker who uses gahiiŋ, 'thence', regularly. I will draw on
texts from the whole corpus for the description in this section.
