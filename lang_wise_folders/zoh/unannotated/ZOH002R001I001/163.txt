Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
There are some intransitive verbs that accept the passive suffix, in which
case we naturally get the middle voice reading.
(6.25)
tangngømmø de manggu 'okox ya jak pøjitukkø

de.? maŋgu ?okoš ya

be_wide.PASS-COM DCT2.nom1 mango shrub NEG very large-finish-COM
'This mango shrub grew wide, it didn't grow tall.'
(lexicon)
Many transitive verb roots do not allow the passive suffix, although I am
unable to divine any feature common to them all that would explain this
resistance. None of the 'hit' or 'cut' verbs, such as caŋ-, 'to hit with the fist',
nakš-, 'to hit with a piece of wood', or nem-, 'to cut with a scissors', allow a
passive, which at first suggested that it was the entailed instrument argument
that was somehow blocking the passive. (Perhaps it is too agentlike?).
However, other verbs that entail an instrument, such as hepš-, 'to scoop with a
dipper', and hi?p-, 'to move with a little stick', do admit passivization, so that
hypothesis went south. There are roots from all three classes (T1, T2, and T3)
in the no-passives group. Judgements about passive forms were generally the
most unstable of all the grammatical phenomena tested: one year (or week) my
consultants would accept some root with a passive suffix, and the next time
they would not. These forms appear very rarely in the corpus, other than in the
idiomatic constructions shown in (6.27). Perhaps it's simply a marginal form,
and we should not make too much of these inconsistencies. It is effectively a
form of impersonal in MIG Zoque, and there are other ways of impersonalizing
verbs (including the suffix -Anəm, IMPERS), so perhaps the passive is simply
less preferred in most contexts.
