13.2.2. Negative imperative
The negative imperative has its own negative morpheme, ?u (NEGimpv),
followed by a person agreement marker in its cliticized form. The verb is
inflected with the negative imperative suffix -wə (nIMPV). In the second person,
it simply means "Don't do X!", illustrated in example (13.28 i-iii). In the first or
third persons, however, it has a more subjunctive quality: "that I
(he/she/they/it) shouldn't do X". The remaining examples in (13.28) illustrate
this usage.
