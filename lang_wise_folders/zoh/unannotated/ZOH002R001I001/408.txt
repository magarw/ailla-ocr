(i)
Many stories end with question about what the main characters will do
next (Sr. Sánchez is particularly fond of this technique). But personal narratives
don't admit this sort of wrap-up, and they are often terminated by saying "Well,
that's that". This expression, shown in (14.27), is formed on the neutral deictic.
The example is the end of 'A Housewife's Day'. Paired with its distal
counterpart, it is a normal way to signal the end of a section of conversation as
well. (Example (ii) is from my memory of such conversations.)
