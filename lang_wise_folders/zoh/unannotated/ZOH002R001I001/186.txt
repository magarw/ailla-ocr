7.1.1.8. nik
This morpheme means 'VERB on the surface of X', hence the gloss code
SURF(ace). It especially applies to verbs of spraying, spreading, or splattering,
and particularly applies to VERBing on someone's body. Productive use of this
prefix by the unwary may cause embarassment, since it apparently is used in a
number of off-color terms. nik- always co-occurs with the suffix -?ǝy.
