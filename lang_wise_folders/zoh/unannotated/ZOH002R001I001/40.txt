Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
2.2. Theoretical sketch
My goal in this grammar is to present the facts of MIG Zoque with as little
theoretical machinery as possible. The only theory that I found that applies well
to this language without significant modification is the functionalist theory of
Role and Reference Grammar (RRG). In this section, I will give a very brief
sketch of this framework, touching only on those parts of it that are used in this
description. The basis of this sketch is Van Valin and La Polla (1997). Other
relevant works are Van Valin 1993b; Van Valin and Foley, 1980; and Foley and
Van Valin 1984.
Clauses are analysed into three layers: the nucleus, which contains only
the predicate; the core, which contains the nucleus and the arguments lexically
specified by the predicate; and the periphery, which contains all non-core
arguments and adjunct expressions. Predicates are typically verbs, but they
may also be adjectives or nouns, in languages like MIG Zoque that do not
require a copular verb in predicating expressions such as 'Mary is an astronaut.'
This division of the clause is illustrated in the following figure.
