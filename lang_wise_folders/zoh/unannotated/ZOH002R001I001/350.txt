13.1.4. Incompletive
Incompletive "viewpoints present part of a situation with no information
about its endpoints" (Smith, 1991:111). The incompletive is used to refer to
ongoing situations in the past, to habitual or present situations, to generic
situations, and to situations that will obtain in the future. It is translated with
the Spanish imperfect or present tense, depending on the discourse context.
(The Spanish present tense is also covers habitual, ongoing, and future
situations.)
In the narrative texts in the corpus, the imperfect is used to describe
ongoing background situations, like the waterfall in example (13.9 i), or to set
the scene by describing situations that were ongoing at the time the story
begins. It is also used to present the immediate context of some specific
situation, appearing in a subordinate clause (iii-v).
