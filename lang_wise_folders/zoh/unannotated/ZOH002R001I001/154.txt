Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
We also find causatives and antipassives in a complex formed with a
transitive verb root. Sometimes there is a subtle shift in the meaning of the
verb, as in example (6.19 i) where the causative added to the verb kəš- 'to eat'
yields an expression meaning 'to feed' (and 'to eat' is regularly rendered with
the verb root and the antipassive, since kəš- is a T3 verb root that requires the
antipassive in order to appear without an expressed object).
Most commonly, the antipassive is used to suppress the verb root's
normal object and then the causative is used to make this objectless form
transitive. This highlights the causing of the event, discarding the patient as
relatively unimportant.
