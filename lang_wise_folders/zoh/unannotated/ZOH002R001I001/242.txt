The other directional roots in MIG Zoque are not part of the set of
auxiliary verbs, but they do appear frequently in compound constructions.
Syntactically, the examples in (8.24) are a mixed bag. In (i-iii), V1 and the
motion verb share the same actor: the water cuts going down, the jaguar turns
as it jumps, and the man stands stock-still. In (iv-vii), the subject of the
intransitive V2 motion verb is actually the object (undergoer) of the transitive
V1. They are all included here to illustrate the range of possibilities in
directional verbs.
