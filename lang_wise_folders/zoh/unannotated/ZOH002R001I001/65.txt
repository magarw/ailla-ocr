3.3.8. Syllable contraction
When two vowels are juxtaposed, through deletion of a glottal stop
(3.3.7) or some (unknown) historical process, they contract to form a single
syllable. This is evident at the ends of words where the contraction produces
an irregular primary stress on the final syllable. This is the result we would
expect if stress were assigned to the penultimate syllable, according to the
regular rule, and then the ultimate syllable is lost.
(3.14)
(i)
dey dø minnám
dey də+ min-wǝ+?am
now 1A+ come-COM+NOW
'Now I have come.'
(4) glottal stop deletes
(5) vowels contract
(6) gemination
(ii)
In example (3.14 i), the /ə/ of the completive suffix becomes an /a/, in
harmony with the clitic vowel. Then the intervocalic glottal stop deletes, and
then the vowels contract. The completive suffix syllable, which had the stress
at the beginning of this process by the regular penultimate stress rule, keeps it.
The vowel that survives the contraction is the one that had the stress, so the
stress stays here instead of moving back to the preceding syllable (although in
context, sometimes this final stress is very weak).
So, the rules apply in the following order:
(1)
(2) stress assignment
(3) vowel harmony
