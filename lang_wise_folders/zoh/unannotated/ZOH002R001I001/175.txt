Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
Chapter 7: Derivational Morphology
The discussion in this chapter is divided into three parts: verbal affixes
that have primarily semantic import, including directional prefixes and
positional suffixes (7.1); affixes that derive nouns and adjectives from verb
roots (7.2); and affixes that derive verbs from nouns, adjectives, and numbers
(7.3).
7.1. Verbal affixes
A complete template of verbal affixes is shown in table 2.1. Inflectional
affixes are discussed in chapter 5, valency-changing affixes are discussed in
chapter 6, and those suffixes and post-verbal clitics that have an effect on
aspect are discussed in chapter 14. This chapter covers the remaining verbal
affixes, whose function is most purely semantic; that is, they chiefly serve to
alter the meaning of the verb root, rather than to manipulate its grammatical
structure. The directional prefixes are covered in section 7.1.1. Positional
suffixes are discussed in section 7.1.2. Section 7.1.3. contains a description of
the perseverative suffix -ten, which is in some ways similar to the positional
suffix -ney, but carries a volitional or intentional meaning as well. Section
7.1.4. discusses the suffix -?«ùy, whose function and possible contribution to
meaning are opaque.
