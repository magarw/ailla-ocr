Johnson / A Grammar of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque
new instrumental using -kuy?. It frequently appears attached to stems with the
antipassive suffix -7oy, reasonably, since there's no need to be specific about
objects when identifying a tool. There are also examples of this suffix with
prefixed stems, compounded stems, and even stems with an incorporated
noun. The meaning of words formed with -kuy? are usually instrumental,
sometimes locative, and sometimes purely idiosyncratic. The gloss for this
morpheme is INSTR1.
