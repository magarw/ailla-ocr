set of positional affixes that refer to the resultant shape and state of the
undergoer argument. Both noun incorporation and verb stem compounding are
highly productive processes in this language. Dependent verb constructions can
also be formed with a small set of auxiliary verbs; these constructions exhibit
an agreement pattern known as ergative shift. Verb compounding is another
extremely productive and powerful process in this language. This grammar also
discusses syntax within the clause and in multi-clausal expressions, including
relative clauses, coordinated and comparative clauses, and subordinate clauses.
It includes chapters on question formation and aspect. Finally, there is
discussion of discourse-level processes, including word order and discourse
markers. The use of Spanish grammatical function words, independently and in
tandem with Zoque formatives, is discussed where relevant.
This grammar, along with the lexicon and the corpus of texts on which it
is based, are accessible to the public at the Archive of the Indigenous
Languages of Latin America (www.ailla.utexas.org.).
