\CMTS HAJ reviewed the entire dictionary in 1997. She
She ported it to
Shoebox 3.0 (windows version). First pass was mostly clean-up:
(1) standardizing record formats to match the Summer 1996 specs
(2) completing examples (all four fields: EXU, XPSH, XSP, XEN)
and adding capitalization and punctuation where appropriate (3)
adding English translations where possible (some translations
come from RZ) (4) getting all the supplemental fields filled in
where they could be (SPL, SLGR, SLGL
it has to be 4
characters, you can't search for a 5 char field name!) (5)
completing MB fields where possible (6) standardizing morpheme
characters (so that, e.g., ANTIP is always derivational, not
sometimes derivation and sometimes inflection) (7) dumped entries
with no glosses and a few other odd bits (the ones that had
DENIED by GSM in the comments, for example) into an
appendix database.
\CMTS Second pass: (1) added lots of example sentences and a few new
verbs from the 95-96 field work (2) checked all ROOT and
RTGR fields to make sure the same thing is said of every root
wherever it is mentioned (3) added SBD and SPR info
\date
\CMTS 1998: HAJ added SUB and SUPER data to verb roots. Also added new
fields NOM (nominalized forms, like .kuy7) and ARG for roots that entail a
specific argument other than subject, like instrument.
\CMTS 1999: HAJ added deictic, spatial and temporal adverbials
