The data in this file was collected in Forti*n by Heidi Johnson (HAJ) and TK
in July and August of 1994.
It was keyboarded by Viviana Zavala Luna during July-August 1994 in Forti*n.
HAJ massaged and updated the file in Fall 1994 and sent the updated database
to TK along with the slip file.
TK annotated the slip file and in Spring 1995 Cheri Ritchey entered these
annotations in HAJ's version of the database.

HAJ worked on this file during June and July 1995 in Catemaco, correcting
spelling and refining glosses, but she made no textual annotations at this
point.
HAJ reviewed Spanish glosses with the aim of producing good English glosses
in June 1996, Catemaco. She re-checked verb meanings and categories with
2 consultants (GSM and CMS) in San Miguel during January through May 1996,
and got example sentences for most verb roots. This data had for the most
part NOT been entered by 23 June 1996.
\date 07/Aug/01
\DATE 29/Jan/2000
TK went through the existing lexical database with GSM 24-27 June 1996.
Any date stamps in June 1996 as of 22 June 1996 and earlier reflect editing
or additions by HAJ. Any dates 24-27 June 1996 reflect editing by TK.

How this database is set up.
It looks like the REL clitic that occurs after verbs is underlyingly
//+v7k//, which would come from *+p@7k and be the same as the post-nominal
variant of SOT (In SOT the post-verbal variant is //+7pv//, from *+p@7).
But it might come from *+w@7k: if so, it would conflict with what is in MAR,
so I have not chosen to notate that possibility.
.way occurs as depositive
continue with #tziku
check whether RFL is /7@y+win/ or /7@y+ win/, etc. Adjust accordingly.
spell contracted +7am as +'am GO THRU WHOLE FILE
words ending +jo7k are spelled both <+jo+7k> and <+jo7+k>: make uniformly
<+jo+7k>

\CMTS Germa*n vacillates on the presence of word-final /7/ (IN A FEW WORDS ONLY).
One of these is 7awin(7) `kinsman' another is jajtzuku (7) `ant'. It might
be good to check the tapes made by BRR.
