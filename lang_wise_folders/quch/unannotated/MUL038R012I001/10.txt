EXCLUSIVELY SUFFIXING LANGUAGES
Major thrust of the study is to explore and describe
the characteristics and implications of "exclusively" suffixing lan
languages, that is, languages with no prefix morphemes. Several
such languages will be compared and contrasted. Base of the
comparison will be the clear-cut structure of the applicant's
dissertation language, Tukano. Stand point is that a morpholo-
gy-oriented grammar is the most revealing for appreciating
suffixing languages. Attention will be paid to implications
for methodology, typology, and classification Forning tagant
feels that Tukano furnishes a classic but hitherto unknown
example of Sapir's agglutinative type of language; in fact, it
may represent a new, albeit minor, subtype, namely those without
prefix morphemes. Inasmuch as there are many such languages
in South America, as also elsewhere, this suggests comparison
and contrast of languages of this hypothetical subtype for
correlations and regularities, and, for instance, to explore
indications for hypothetical structural pressuring. Particular
emphasis of the study will be on the structures formed by the
position classes of suffixes.
