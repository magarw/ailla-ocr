Purpose of this study is to explore and describe the charac-
teristics of "exclusively" suffixing languages, that is, of

ological, typological, and classificational implications of

ined. Base of comparison will be the clear-cut structure of
applicant's dissertation language, Tukano, and operational
standpoint is that of morphology-oriented grammar.
