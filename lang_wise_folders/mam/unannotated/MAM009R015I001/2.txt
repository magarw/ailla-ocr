The person/number system in Mam is of interest because
it differs somewhat from that of other Mayan languages, and
because it places primary emphasis on first person and less
emphasis on second person, while the presence of third
person is practically unmarked. Number is inseparable
from person.
In this paper I intend to explain the details of the
Mam person/number system and show how the differing emphasis
on the various persons is correlated with the type of element
which marks each one. First person is indicated by affixes,
second person by clitics, and third person by words. Since
person/number is part of the obligatory grammatical system
of the language, and is realized simultaneously on several
grammatical levels, it must have considerable structural
weight in the language. An examination of the notion of the
linguistic postulate can help to evaluate the importance
of such structures in any particular language.
Other Mayan languages have a person system in which
the distinctions first, second, third person singular and
plural are indicated by prefixes on substantive and verb
stems. Mam distinguishes between first person and non-first
person singular and plural by the use of prefixes, and
along with this basic division of persons further marks
presence or absence of second person. In this way all the
usual persons found in other Mayan languages are also found
