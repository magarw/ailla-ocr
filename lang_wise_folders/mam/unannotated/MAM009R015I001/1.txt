The research we have been engaged on has been conducted
over a period of two years under the auspices of the Proyecto
Lingüístico Francisco Marroquin in Antigua Guatemala.
During that time I have been supported by the United States
Peace Corps. Terrence Kaufman has been the Technical direc-
tor of our work.
All of the examples are written in the practical phonemic
orthography designed for Mam by Terrence Kaufman and used
at the Proyecto Lingüístico Francisco Marroquín. This
orthography is:
