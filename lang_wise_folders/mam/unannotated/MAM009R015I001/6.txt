The pronouns are somewhat more complicated in construc-
tion, but the same distinctions between first and non-first
person are maintained, and the same enclitics are used to
distinguish the other persons. In Mam there are not any truly
independent pronouns; the closest thing to an independent
pronoun is formed on a demonstrative root. In addition,
stative and locative relationships are pronominally expressed.

The demonstratives and statives add pronoun roots to
the demonstrative or noun to form the first person singular
or plural, while only enclitics indicate non-first persons.
The locative pronouns have an optional demonstrative plus
a morpheme of location t- plus suffixes which indicate
presence or absence of first person plus the usual enclitics.
The major difference between the pronouns and nouns or verbs
is that with the demonstratives and statives plural of non-
first person is only indicated by the morpheme [qa-}
