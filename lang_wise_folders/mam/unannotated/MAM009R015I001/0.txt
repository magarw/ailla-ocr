PERSON IN MAM

A paper presented at the annual meetings of
the American Anthropological Association
November 1973
The data in this paper are from the dialect of Mam
spoken in San Ildefonso Ixtahuacán, Department of Huehuete-
nango, Guatemala. Mam has three major dialect groups, and
this particular dialect is of the northern group. (Terrence
Kaufman, personal communication) I have also been working
with a dialect of southern Mam, that spoken in San Juan
Ostuncalco, Department of Quezaltenango, Guatemala, and the
data presented here are consistent with the dialect of
Ostuncalco, although details differ. Further data from
other dialects of Mam have been consulted. (Kaufman, Froman
and Mendoza 1970-1973 and Canger 1969)
In Ixtahuacán I have worked primarily with two Mam
speakers, Juan Maldonado Andrés and Juan Ordóñez Domingo,
and in Ostuncalco I have worked primarily with Carlos Alberto
Tirado Gómez and Macario Méndez Romero. These four men
have been my students and co-workers for two years, and my
analysis of Mam has been possible only through their collabo-
ration and interest. They are directly responsible for the
collection of a large portion of our data, and have been
intimately involved in its analysis. To them I owe many
