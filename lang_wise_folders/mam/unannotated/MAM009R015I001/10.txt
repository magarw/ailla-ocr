the usual prefixes, a type of reduplication. This requires
absence of the enclitics, but the non-first persons refer
to second person in spite of the lack of formal marking with
enclitics.
Example: .
w-n-ja:
t-t-ja:
q-q-ja:
ky-ky-ja:
q'a
txin
my house

your house
There are several further points to be mentioned about
the person/number system in Mam. The preceding has been
an outline of the major elements of the system, and as can
be seen, third person is not marked in any instance. One
way to clarify third person participation, other than explicit
use of a noun referring directly to that person, is to use
a set of specific third person pronominal words which follow
the possessed substantive or verb. These indicate sex and
age of the person, or whether the actor is an animal, and are:
