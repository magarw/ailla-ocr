-8-
optional plural which can occur with any substantive.
Mam could be described as having a seven person system
if the prefixes and enclitics are considered as being of
equal status and if in all instances they act together to
distinguish all the possible relationships. This analysis
however is not consistent with the way in which the various
person morphemes actually perform. The first person/non-
first person distinction is made by prefixes which are
always obligatory in a phrase indicating person. These
prefixes are closely tied to the stem of the substantive
or verb. Second person is indicated by enclitics which are
obligatory in some constructions but absent in others..
Their strength of marking is weaker than the prefixes, and
since they occur final in the phrase, much can intervene
between the stem and the enclitic. Third person is only
indicated by a set of optional pronominal words which follow
the substantive or verb.
Set A and Set B prefixes distinguish the agent and
patient of transitive verbs, but the same enclitics can in-
dicate either agent or patient, so that certain combinations
of agent and patient are ambiguous.
For example,
