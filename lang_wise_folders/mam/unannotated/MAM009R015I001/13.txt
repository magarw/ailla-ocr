emphasis given to the actors, with first person being most
strongly marked and third person least strongly marked.
On the morphological level, this distinction is realized
in verb and noun inflection. On the syntactic level it is
realized in pronoun formation, in possessive constructions,
and in the sub-class of substantives which are called sub-
stantive relationals. This is an interesting class of words
which are largely formed from noun roots, are possessed
exactly like nouns, but have the special syntactic function
of indicating those relationships which in English are
indicated by prepositions. The possessive affixes indicate
the person or object to whom the relationship is expressed.
On the semantic level the person system is realized
by the existence of several classes of nouns: those that
are inherently possessed and add suffixes in the non-possessed
form, those that are inherently possessed and cannot be used
without a possessor, and nouns which can be possessed or not
without any other change. It is interesting to note that
the first class of inherently possessed nouns (body parts,
clothing, relatives, and some foods) are normally possessed
by persons, while the second class of inherently possessed
nouns (frequently component parts of objects) are normally
possessed by objects and therefore are generally not used
with first or second person possession.
The system is realized at several grammatical levels,
