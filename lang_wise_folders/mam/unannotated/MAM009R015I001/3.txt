in Mam, with the addition of first person plural exclusive.
The mechanisms by which Mam distinguishes the persons are
significantly different, however.
Person is morphologically marked on verb, noun, sub-
stantive relational and pronoun stems. Syntactically person
may be expressed by substantive relational words, pronouns,
and in possessive relationships. The basic person distinc-
tions are morphologically marked by two sets of prefixes,
Set A and Set B, which have separate uses and are found in
complementary distribution. Set A prefixes indicate the
possessor of nouns and substantive relationals, the agent
of transitive verbs with object inclusion in the verb, and
the subject of intransitive verbs in certain types of sub-
ordinate constructions. Set B prefixes indicate the patient
of transitive verbs and the subject of intransitive verbs
in independent clauses. The sets are as follows:
A
+18
n- ~ W-
B
t-
chin-N7in-
1
-1sg
Øtz-Ntz'-k-
+1pl
9-
qo (7)- 70 (7) -
-1p²
ky-
chi-7i-
These in combination with one set of enclitics (always
final in the phrase) indicate all the person relationships.
There are four different enclitics which in this dialect

of Mam are homophonous and have the form {-a-ya}.
