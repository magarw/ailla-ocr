clitics for second person, and words for third person.
The particular organization of the person/number system
in Mam is pervasive throughout the language, being found in
the morphology, semantics and syntax. All of the more
peripheral elements of the system, such as the emphatics,
strengthen the analysis of Mam person/number as being firstly
marking of plus or minus first person, secondly and more
weakly plus or minus second person, and thirdly and very
weakly marking of third person. What can such a strong
structure in a language imply in terms of language organ-
ization? The notion of the linguistic postulate, as proposed
by Hardman, is of interest in this context.
Linguistic postulates are defined by Hardman as
"...those recurrent categorizations in the language
which are most directly and most tightly tied to the
perceptions of the speakers, those elements which,
while language imposed, are so well imposed that speakers
consider them just naturally part of the universe;...
The most powerful postulates are those involved in the
obligatory grammatical system....Typically, a postulate
is realized at several levels either simultaneously,
in complementary distribution, or both, depending on
the context....they tend to remain after divergence."
(Hardman, 1973)
What is of interest here is not that Mam indicates person
and number, but rather the specific organization of the sys-
tem and how it categorizes the possible actors involved in
any situation. Of particular interest is the differential
