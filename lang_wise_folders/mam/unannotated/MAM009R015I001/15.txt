FOOTNOTES
¹The allomorphs of the first person singular prefix of Set
A are phonologically conditioned. {n- occurs before con-
sonants and {w- occurs before vowels. The allomorphs of
the Set B prefixes are almost entirely morphologically con-.
ditioned, and the conditioning depends largely on aspect.

{-a occurs after consonants and {-ya after vowels.
3The finus second person singular or plural allomorph
-ya of the enclitic has the free variants /-ky'a, -ky!,
-y¹/ when used with substantives.
Apparently some dialects of Mam do not have enclitic A.
(Canger, 1969) No confusion arises because only the exclu-
sive option can be realized.
