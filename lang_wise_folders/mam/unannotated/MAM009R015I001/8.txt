context. Prefix A for agent requires the enclitic, so there
is no way to distinguish between second and third person
singular patient.

-1pl +1pl
either -2pl or +2pl
can mean 'we (a group) hit them, or 'we (a group) hit you-
all', or possibly 'we-all hit you-all'although this last is
not really permitted semantically, since we-all must in-
clude you-all.
There are two ways of emphasizing the persons involved
in a verbal or possessive construction, each of which makes
only the basic first person/non-first person, singular and
plural distinctions. This adds considerable strength to the
analysis.
The first type of emphasis uses the Set A person markers
immediately before the set of enclitics, in addition to the
appropriate set of person prefixes. This can be used with
verbs to indicate either agent or patient and with nouns
or substantive relationals to indicate the possessor. In
all instances the enclitic is required. This means that
only first person exclusive and second person, singular and
plural, can be emphasized in this way.
