From the analysis it is clear that the enclitics have at
least two functions, that of excluding second person and
that of marking presence of second person, and it is probable
that they also distinguish singular and plural. A comparison
with other dialects of Mam shows that some of these dialects
have non-homophonous enclitis to distinguish person (Kaufman,
Froman and Mendoza, 1970 - 1973; Canger, 1969), and it seems
probable that they have become homophonous in Ixtahuacan
through various phonological processes which do not operate
in all dialects. The absence of an enclitic with a parti-
cular prefix indicates the opposite of the enclitic. 3
