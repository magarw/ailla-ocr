"Dummy! You don't remember! Last Friday a guy was drinking chicha with three
girls at the "Sweet mouth" chichería. We were sitting at a table behind the door.
When I went to pee after drinking a lot, then the big guy came over to me and
offered me his hand to say hello," Faustino said.
-"Ahhh. Juk p'aqu liq'iyuq yuqalla ih?"- ñispataq Waltikuqa tapurisqa.

"Yes, him!" Last year at the Tata Santiago¹2 festival I saw him with a beautiful
young woman, I went over to greet Maximiliano. Then he bought an ice cream for
the young woman. After that, when I asked "who's that" Maximiliano told me “my
little sister". If you could just see her, his sister, a beautiful girl, small white face,
crystal clear hazel eyes, she's a beautiful young woman" Faustino said.
