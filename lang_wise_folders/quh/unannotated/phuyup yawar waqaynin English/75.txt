"Dear citizens, listen well. All of us who live in these communities have seen
ourselves in a great hardship. If we don't do anything, then we'll find ourselves in
a worse situation. This morning Juvenal Castro, the mayor of Anzaldo, has come to
talk with us. Now he'll tell us what we're going to do." Valerio said.

"Citizens of Kalallusta, a big greeting to you all. As Valerio Soto said, I'm the
mayor of Anzaldo, and so I work for Walter Guevara with all my heart," he said
loudly.

"I come now to tell you about a tragedy. Citizens! Over in Yambata Victor Paz
Estenssoro's men have really made the people suffer, they killed them, and took
everything from them. Now they are already preparing to come to Anzaldo, and
kill us the same way. We won't just watch that happen! We have to go fight!" Tata
Juvenal said loudly, shaking.
