mother had to go and ask for the woman's hand. It couldn't be just the mother or
just the father who went to ask. Because of this, Faustino begged his father from
his knees to help him in asking for Francisca's hand.
Chayjinamanta chay p'unchawqa parlaq churakusqanku, Fransiskata mañaqaq
rinankupaq.
And then, they started to talk that day about going to ask for Francisca's hand.
-"Sumaqta wayk'unachik, chantapis achkha aqhata apananchik tiyan"- ñispa tata
Fransiskuqa phiña phiñalla parlarisqa.

And that's what they did. The next day at dawn they killed five chickens and
cooked the food to take with them. They also prepared four jugs of chicha and
loaded them on to a donkey. Then tata Fransisco, mama Inkarna, Faustino and
Francisca headed off for Muruq'u Urqu. Tata Francisco mounted a big horse, and
