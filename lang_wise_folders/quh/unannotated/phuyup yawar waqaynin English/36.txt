In 1944, as the years went on Faustino became a young man. He was a big man,
with black hair, brown eyes, and a slightly rough face. He had short pants, and
always walked around in a brown poncho. He knew how to play the carnival songs
well on the accordion and the charango. He knew both the songs and the dances.
By then he was going to Anzaldo by himself.

Fridays were market day in Anzaldo. They sold everything there. Every Friday,
Faustino got up as soon as the rooster crowded. He quickly took out fresh clothes,
got dressed and combed his hair.
Juk ch'askachaw paqarinqa, q'uñi yakuta mut'itawan

masinqa yuthujina khuyurimusqa pacha.
One Friday morning, Mama Inkarna had made boiled corn for breakfast for all her
children. When Faustino had almost finished eating, his friend Waltiku whistled
out like a bird.
