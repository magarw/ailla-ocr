Leoncio said, speaking to everyone.
Faustinup masikunanqa, -“kunititan kutimusqayku”- ñispa, tumpata chay qutumantaqa
karuchakapusqanku. Jinallapitaq Kalallustaman ririkapuchkasqanku. Fransiskap

"We're going back right away", Faustino's friends said, distancing themselves a bit
from the group. And just like that, they went off to Kalallusta. Francisca's friends
were still waiting in the door of the church, curious. When they still hadn't
appeared, Faustino went to call his friends, but no one wanted to come. He went
back to the door of the church, sobbing. Sad and alone, he headed off to Muruq'u
Urqu with some of his wife's family. Right afterwards, Waltiku and Guadalupe set
off after Faustino to Muruq'u Urqu.

Many people ate and danced at the party. People went up to the bride and groom to
give them money and they gave more to the bride, they gave maybe only a fifth as
much to the groom. Francisca's money was in a circle on her back. After seeing
this, the people grumbled "These two will live like cats and dogs".
