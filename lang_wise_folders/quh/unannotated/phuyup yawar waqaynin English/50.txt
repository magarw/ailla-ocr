Para parapi Waltikuqa manapuni mantanta qupuyta munasqachu. Astawan uqllaykusqa
manataq kacharisqañachu. Ajinamanta chay karnawal raymi ch'isi Waltikuqa
Wadalupita wasinman suwakapusqa.
In the pouring rain, Waltiku really didn't want to give her blanket back to her. He
hugged her tighter and wouldn't let her go. That's how Waltiku got Guadalupe to
his house that Carnival evening.
Faustinuwan wakinkunawan imataq sinchi machasqa Waltikumantawan
Wadalupimantawanqa mana yuyarikullasqankupischu. Parapi ñak'ayta P’uqru Pata

wasinkunaman ripurasqanku. Maximilianoqa Faustinup wasillanpiña puñuq
qhipakusqa, ichapis Kalallustamanta wasinmanqa sinchi karuraq kasqa.
Faustinu and the others were so drunk they forgot all about Waltiku and
Guadalupe. In the rain, they crossed the P'uqru Pata river with difficulty, the
water up to their knees. After crossing over the water, everyone went off to their
own home. Maximiliano just stayed at Faustino's house to sleep, probably because
it was still so far from Kalallusta to his house.
Q’ayantin p’unchaw, Faustinuwan Maximilianowanqa uma nanaywan sayarimusqanku.
Mama Inkarna yaku-q'uñita iskay jatun tutumapi jaywasqa, juk t'uru ch’illamipi yuraq

parlarikusqanku:
The next day, Faustino and Maximiliano got up with headaches. Mama Inkarna
brought tea in two big bowls, she also offered them one clay bowl with white corn
porridge and a piece of cheese. While they were eating this, they talked:
-"Sumaqta qayna karnawalpi quchinchik ih?"- ñisqa Faustinu.
"We had a great Carnival yesterday, didn't we?” Faustino said.
