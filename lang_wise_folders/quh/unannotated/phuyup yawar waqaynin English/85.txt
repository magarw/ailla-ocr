When they were all walking, it was the time of year when the corn was good and
ripe. When they saw the corn, everyone broke off into groups and picked the cobs
of corn. Then all the people from Soyco, and those from Anzaldo, cooked boiled
corn in an enormous bowl. Everyone ate the delicious food.

During all this, the men from Toro Toro arrived in Soyco, at the bank of the river.
They were good and ready to attack the next day and kill everyone.

That night there was a torrential rainstorm. Every time it rained, lots of murky
water filled the Caine river, and people couldn't cross the river, even cars couldn't
cross the river. If someone should enter the river, they would soak up the water like
a corn cob.
