had soaked into the boiling water. She left it for one night to germinate. The next
day, she strained the water and filled another bowl all the way up to the top, then
she boiled it again until the acidity was gone. At this point, it is called upi.
Chay ch'isiqa, misk'i q'itata paylapi sankhunankama chayachisqa.
That night, she cooked the germinated corn in the bowl until it thickened into
dough.
Q'ayantin p'unchawtaq, upita t'impuchisqanta wak wirkhiman pata patanta
jurqhullasqataq, chay uranpi qunchu qhipakusqanmantataq achkha ñiqita
jurqhusqanku.
The next day, she again poured the upi into another pot to boil it, and everyone
took from the dregs that were left on the bottom of that pot.
Chaymantataq upimanqa, mama Inkarnawan Libiritawan, Juliawan imaqa utqhayllata
misk'i q'itataqa makinkuwan q'allpiykusqanku. Chayta tukuchiytawanqa, phichqa
p'unchawta aqhataqa puquchisqanku.
Then mama Inkarna, Libirita and Julia squeezed the dough into little pieces with
their hands in the upi. When that was done, they had chicha in five days.
Karnawal raymiman juk p'unchaw kachkaptin, mama Inkarna p’uyñuta taparaytawan,
aqhata uña tutumapi juk chhikata jurqhuytawan, tata Fransiskuman llamirichisqa.
When it was one day before Carnival, mama Inkarna uncovered the jug, took out a
little bit with a small bowl, and gave it to tata Francisco to try.
-"Q'ultin, q'ultin, q'ultin! Sumaq aqha kasqa karaju!"- ñispa tata Fransiskuqa tutumatal
ch'usaqyachisqa.
