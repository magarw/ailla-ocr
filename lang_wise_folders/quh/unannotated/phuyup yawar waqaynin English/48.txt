At Carnival that year they danced, singing about everything and teasing each other,
and they were very happy.
Chhaqpuyaytañaqa pata qhawariptinkuqa, yana phuyu tantarikuyta qallaririchkasqanku.
Jukllata "lliphiq, lliphiq!" ñiytawan paraqa "qhururun qhururun!" uyaririkusqa.
Faustinuwan masikunanwanqa Alfa Mayullamantaraq alliymanta sumaq machasqa
thatkirimuchkasqanku.
At dusk, when they looked up at the sky, black clouds were beginning to gather.
Suddenly the thunder crashed and they heard the rain falling. Faustino and his
friends were still walking slowly on their way from Alfa Mayu, really drunk.
Alfa Mayuqa juk k'acha ayllu, juk jatun urqu sikipi. Achkha yukaliktu sach'a tiyan.
Mana ancha achkha runachu chaypiqa tiyakunku, juk chunka wasijinalla tiyan.
Chaymanta Kalallustaman chayanapaqqa karuraq, unaytaraq thatkimuna, P’uqru Pata
mayutapis chimpamunaraq kasqa.
Alfa Mayu is a pretty town, at the foot of a big mountain. There are a lot of
yukaliktu trees there. Not many people live in this town, there are only about ten
houses. It's far from there to Kalallusta, there's a long way to walk and the P'uqru
Pata river to cross.
Para sut'uykachariptinkama Faustinukunaqa sinchita mancharikusqanku, chantapis.
P’uqru Pata mayumanta llakirikusqanku. Sapa paraptin kay mayumanqa achkha yaku
unaymanta pacha yapakamun.
As soon as the rain started falling, Faustinu and his friends got very scared, and
then they worried about the P'uqru Pata river. Every time it rained, the river filled
with water after a while.
-"Utqhayta ripunachik, amaña takinachikchu P'uqru Pata mayupi yaku
jark'aykuwasunchik"- ñispa Waltikuqa sinchi sinchimanta parlasqa.
