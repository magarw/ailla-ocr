Luwisaqa chayta uyariytawanqa punku wasapi sunqu nanayta waqaq churakusqa.
Luwisa heard this and started crying with heartfelt pain on the back of the door.
Chaymantaqa wayk'una wasiman yaykusqa. Mama Fransiska chaypi Fortunato sullk'a
wawanman mut'iyakituta sunqu nanayta upichichkasqa.
Then he went into the kitchen. There, mama Francisca was giving his young son
Fortunato mote water to drink, very sad.
-“¿Imaptintaq ajinata saqirpariwayku? ¿mayman chinkankiri?"- ñispa warminqa
qusanta rikuytawan sumaq phiñasqa parlasqa.
"Why did you just leave us like that? where did you disappear to?" his wife said
angrily to her husband when she saw him.
Jukninqa ch'inllamanta warmintaqa makinpi uña wawa jap'irisqata qhawarisqa.
Sumaqta qhawallasqapuni, mama Fransiskap p'achanqa thantataq llik'isqataq kasqa.
Juk'utanpis q'ala p’itisqa manaña sumaqta puriytapis atisqañachu.
Silently, he looked at his wife, she was holding the young child in her arms. He
kept looking at her, mama Francisca's clothes were worn out and torn. Her sandals
too were broken in parts, and she couldn't walk well anymore.
-"Guillermito awtupi tikrakuspa wañupun"- ñispa Faustinu willarisqa.
"The truck flipped over and Guillermo died," Faustino told her.
-"-¿Ja?"- ñispa Fransiska sinchita qhaparisqa.
"What?!" Francisca cried out.
