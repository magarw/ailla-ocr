One Sunday many people from all the communities in the area, women, men boys
and girls, arrived at dawn at the door to tata Francisco's house. The rooster hadn't
even crowed yet. It was the day that tata Francisco and mama Inkarna were going
to have them harvest the potatoes.
Sapa wata paykuna achkhatapuni papataqa puquchiq kasqanku, ni pipis Kalallusta
juch’uy ayllupi ajinata papata puquchiqchu, paykunallapuni sumaqta puquchiq kaq
kasqanku. Chayraykutaq tukuy runakunaqa papa allayman allaysiq utqhayllata jamuq
kasqanku.
They grew so many potatoes every year, no one else in the little town of Kalallusta
grew potatoes like that, they had always been the best farmers. And because of
this, everyone rushed to help dig up potatoes at harvest time.
Jinallapi jukta k'anka qhapariptinkama tata Fransisku sayarisqa. Kuka wayaqanta
juqharikuytawankama, juk pikchuta tukuspa jawaman lluqsisqa. Achkha runakunata
rikuytawanqa tapusqa:
Tata Francisco got up as soon as the rooster crowed. He took out his coca bag and
chewed a bit right away, then he went out. He saw all the people and asked:
-"¿Qamkunachu papa allayman yanapakuq jamurqankichik?"- umanta
juqharispa sinchimanta parlarispa tapurisqa.
