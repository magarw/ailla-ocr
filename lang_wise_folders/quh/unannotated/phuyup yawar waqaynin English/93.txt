Some of the men went back home when they got to Anzaldo, and others carried
Ricardo's dead body all the way to his home in Sacabamba. Ricardo's wife let out
a loud sob and then kept crying as she looked at her dead husband.
Jinapitaq chay Anzaldo chirupi ch'ampaykuna ch’inyasqa. Tata Victor Paz Estenssorota
yanapaqkunamanta Rosendo Causiri wañusqa, tata Pedro Caritamanta mana
yachakusqachu. Tata Fermin Torricotaqa jaqay Cochira 24 ayllupi sunqu nanayta
wañuchisqanku, umanta khuchurparisqanku, chantataq warminta San Pedro de Buena

Torricop umanta papawkitajina juk chirumantataq wak chirumantataq asirikuspa

And then, just like that, the battle in Anzaldo fell quiet. Rosendo Causiri, of tata
Victor Paz Estenssoro's men, had died, they didn't know anything about tata Pedro
Carita. They killed tata Fermin Torrico over in Cochira24, he was killed in a sad
way, they cut off his head right away, and then made his wife carry it in her shawl
to the San Pedro de Buena Vista Plaza, dripping blood. In that plaza they kicked
Torrico's head back and forth like a ball, laughing.
