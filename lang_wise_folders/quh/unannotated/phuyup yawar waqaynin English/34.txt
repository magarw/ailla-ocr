tightly with his hand he tossed it under the pot in the middle of the fire.
-"¡Ama jinaychu!"- ñisqapis mama Inkarnaqa.
"Don't do that!" cried Mama Inkarna.
Lisu Fransiskuqa ni uyarillasqapischu. Ninaman uritutaqa chuqaykuytawan k'aspiwan
payla urapi kawsachkaqta wañunankama kanaykusqa. Nina ukhupiqa urituqa phutiyta
qhaparispa wañupusqa.
Nasty Francisco didn't even hear her. He threw the parrot in the fire alive, and he
kept it under the pot with a stick, burning it until it was dead. The parrot died in the
fire, screaming in distress.
Faustinuwan yawarmasinkunawan ima, q'ayantin p'unchaw sinchitapuni chayta

The next day, Faustino and his siblings cried so hard when they learned about the
parrot. They were very angry with their father. Tata Francisco beat his children
whenever he felt like it. He was always yelling something, “idiot! stupid! lazy
donkey!". He really hurt Mama Inkarna and the children. Because of this, Mama
Inkarna and her children usually went places alone. Their father didn't even go to
festivals with them. He disappeared to wherever on his own. No one knew, and no
one asked.
-"¡Supaywan purin!, ¡Supaywan parlan!"- Kalallusta ayllupi tiyakuqkuna ñiq kasqanku.
