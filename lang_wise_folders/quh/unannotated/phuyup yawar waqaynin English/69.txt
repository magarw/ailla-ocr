Tata Faustino was a knowledgeable man, like his father. At the time his father
died, he could make wooden spoons very well, and he took them to the market in
Cliza to sell along with his produce.
Chay watakunaqa tukuy Anzaldo chirupi tiyakuqkunaqa, imatapis puquchisqankutaqa
Clizaman wurupi chaqnaykuytawankama ranqhaq apaq kasqanku.
During those years, everyone who lived in Anzaldo loaded whatever they had
grown onto donkeys and took it to Cliza to sell.
