After hearing Waltiku's whistle:
-"Mamay, tatay! Anzaldo qhatuman Waltikuwan richkani"- ñiytawan utqhayllata

"Mama, papa! I'm going to the Anzaldo market with Waltiku” he said and quickly
went out.

Waltiku was also a big young man. Black eyes. He had a black mole on his face.
With a square nose. He always had short pants and went around with a black
shawl. Faustino and Waltiku had been good friends for a long time. They had
always gone around to festivals together. And that day too, the two of them were
heading out to Anzaldo together. That Friday, they walked for two hours, talking
the whole time. These two talked about everything; women, festivals, work, their
parents.
