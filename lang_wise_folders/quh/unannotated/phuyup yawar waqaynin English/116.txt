"And what about mama Francisca, she didn't even see her child buried. Why didn't
you go and get her? Now, what are you going to tell her?"
-“Kunan-pacha Kalallustaman kachaykukusaq, kay Guillermitup p'achanta apakapusaq,
chaypi mamanman willasaq"- ñispa Faustinu kutichispa kachaykukusqa.
"I'm going to Kalallusta right now, I'll take Guillermo's clothes, I'll tell his
mother there," Faustino answered and headed out.

When he got to Anzaldo, he spent the night drinking chicha. The next morning he
got to Kalallusta. He went into the house. As soon as Luwisa saw her father she
said:
-"¡Tatay! ¿Misk'ita, latanuta, laranjata apamurqankichu?"- ñispa payman utqhayta
chimpaykusqa.
"Father! Did you bring sweets, oranges and bananas?" she said, rushing over to
him.
-“¡Mana ni imata apamunichu! ¡Mana qullqiyuq chayakamuchkani!”- ñispa tumpa
machasqaraq sinchita Luwisataqa qhaparisqa.
"I didn't bring anything! I didn't make any money," he yelled at Luwisa, still a
little drunk.
