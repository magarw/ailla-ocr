talked for awhile.
-“Jaku ñuwaqan ripuna, ñuqa qamta munakuyki, qamwan sawachakuyta munani”-
Faustinuqa ñisqa.
"Let's go together, I love you, I want to marry you," Faustino said.
Mana ni imata Fransiska ñisqachu, ch'insitullamanta waynuchup parlasqanta
uyarikusqa. Umanpiqa ajinata t’ukurikusqa:
Francisca didn't say anything, she listened silently to what the young man said. In
her head she thought:
-“Kay qhariqa, tata Fransiskup wawanmin, allintachá paywanqa kawsakuyman, achkha
qullqiyuqchá. Chantapis, pay anchatapuni munakuwan.”- ñispa t’ukurikusqa.
“This man, he's tata Francisco's son, it could be good to marry him, he probably
has a lot of money. And also, he really loves me,” she thought.
Jinallapi chawpi tutataña, tukuy machasqa kachkaptinku, killapis
k'ancharimuchkaptinñaqa, ñan patataña iskayninku makinkunamanta
jap'inaykukuytawan Kalallustaman kachaykurikapuchkasqanku.
And then, in the middle of the night, when they were totally drunk and the moon
was shining down, the two of them took each other by the hand and headed off
down the road to Kalallusta.
Ñanta purichkaspaqa Faustinuqa ajinata t’ukurisqa:
Walking down the road, Faustino thought:
-"Imaynallatataq tataypa wasinman munasqitaywan yaykusaqri?"- ñispa t'ukurikusqa.
