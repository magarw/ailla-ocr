"Now that's how you harvest potatoes!" He said, starting to dig potatoes again.
Papa allaqkuna qhipanmanqa achkha wawakuna papata chaqmaq jamullaqtaq
kasqanku. Paykunaqa, papa allaqkuna ichapis papata mana q'alitutachu pallanku chayta

Many children followed after the harvesters, sifting through the dirt for potatoes.
Perhaps the potato harvesters hadn't collected every single potato, and they could
dig them up themselves to carry home. Maximiliano, a boy from Muruq'u Urqu,
still quite young, had come to the potato harvest with his father to do just this.
-"¡Waway! Qamqa papitata wasiman apakunanchikpaq chaqmakunki"- Maximilianop
tatanqa ñisqa.
"My child! You dig up a few potatoes for us to carry home." Maximiliano's father
said.
-"Manchikuni tatay. Ichapis Tata Fransiskutaraq tapuriwaq"- Maximilianoqa
kutichisqa.
“I'm afraid father. Maybe you could ask tata Francisco?" Maximilano replied.
-"Jaqay, jaqaypi wawan kachkan. Yana liq'iyuq qamjina yuqallitu, payta tapurqamuy
wawitay"- ñispa tatanqa kachasqa.
"There's his son right over there. That little boy with a black hat like you, just go
over and ask him my child." his father said, sending him off.
Jinamanta Maximilianoqa Faustinu chayman puriytawan ajinata tapusqa:

5 Muruq'u Urqu = A small town in the Anzaldo area.
