-"¿Imaynalla kakuchkanki tata Faustinu?"- ñisqa Juvenalqa.
"How are you doing, tata Faustino?" Juvenal said.
-"¡Waliqlla ah! ¿qamri?”- ñispataq kutichisqa.
"Great, and you?" he answered.
-"¿Mayman kachaykukuchkankiri?”- ñispa tata Juvenal tapullasqataq.
"Where are you heading?" tata Juvenal asked.
-"Quchapampaman, Libirata panaypa wasinman waturiq richkani, ichapis jaqaypi
llamk'arikuyman"- ñispa as tumpa llakisqa kutichisqa.
"To Cochabamba, I'm going to my sister Libirata's house to visit, maybe I'll work
there," he answered, just a little sadly.
Libirata sutita uyariytawanqa tata Juvenal llakirikusqataq yuyaririkusqataq. Imaptinchus

When he heard Libirata's name tata Juvenal thought back and grew sad. It was that
when he was much younger, tata Juvenal had really wanted to marry Libirata. But
her father didn't want them to. It was said that Libirata had been pregnant from
Juvenal three times, but not a single one lived. "She has poison milk in her breast",
that's what the people said. So when she gave birth to a baby, she nursed it and it
died. Not a single child lived.
