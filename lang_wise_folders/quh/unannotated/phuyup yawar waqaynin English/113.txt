"Do you only remember how to drink chicha? Where have you been these two
days? Why haven't you come home? Guillermo died and is lying in the hospital,"
Libirata said, speaking very angrily to her brother.
Chayta uyariytawanqa tata Faustinu sinchita mancharikusqa, jukllata -“¡p'uqun!"- ñispa

Faustino heard this and got scared, then suddenly he cried out and fell to the floor.
-"¡Imanantaq! ¿Imanakuchkantaq?"- ñispa chay jatun warmi piwanchus aqhata

"What?! What's happening?" the big woman he had been drinking with cried out.

Everyone drinking in the chichería gathered around. They poured water on him,
but he still didn't wake up. Then they blew on him just a little, and he woke up
with difficulty.
-“¿Imanantaq?”- ñispa Faustinu rikch'ariytawankama tapukusqa.
"What happened?" Faustino asked once he woke up.
