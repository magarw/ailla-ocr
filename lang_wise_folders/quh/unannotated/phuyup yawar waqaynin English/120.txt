A week after that, everyone in Kalallusta prepared the ground to plant the potatoes.
That year Faustino's family planted potatoes in four different places. As soon as
the potato mounds were built, Faustino said:
-"Quchapampaman kutinay tiyan. Kay iskay wawanchiktaqa sumaqta kawsachinanchik
tiyan. Manaña llakiy ñuqanchikpaq chayamunanchu tiyan, ña iskay qhari wawanchikta
wañuqta saqinchikña. Kunanmanta-pacha sumaqta llamk'asaq. Sapa killamanta killa

"I have to go back to Cochabamba. Our two children have to live well. Nothing
else bad can happen to us anymore, we have already lost two male children. From
this point on, I'm going to work hard. Every month I'm going to come back, and
I'll bring food," he said, and again he set off by himself to go back to Cochabamba.
Nisqantajina ruwasqa, sumaqtañamin chaymantapacha llamk'aq kasqa. Juk yunta
wakatapis rantisqankuña. Wakin paqarinqa mama Fransiskakuna wilalitapis upyariqña

From that time, he worked very hard, just like he said he would. He bought a pair
of cows. Now, Francisca and the children drank milk some mornings. They lived
really well.
