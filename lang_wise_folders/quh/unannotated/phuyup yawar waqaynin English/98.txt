That day in the house, mama Francisca and some of her neighbors made a lot of
empty soup. Tata Faustino and Apolonio went to Anzaldo to buy a coffin. Faustino
didn't have a cent, or even a single boliviano, and he cried. He wanted to borrow
from Apolonio. His brother Apolonio felt bad and gave him the money, and then
they went to buy a white coffin to bury the child.

That night they held a vigil for the dead body. And the very next day, they buried
little Albino. Everyone cried in anguish at the cemetery. As they were crying, the
sun went down. Everyone went back to the house. They also brought back the
chicha they had carried with them. Then mama Gabina said:
-“Ama aqhata wasiman apaykuychikchu, watiqmanta mama Fransiskapaq llakiy
chayamullanqañataq”-
"Let's not take chicha to the house, it'll only make Francisca sad again."
Mana uyarillasqankupischu, q'alitu aqha yurukunata apaykuspa wasi ukhupi mana
sayariyta atinankukama upyallasqankupuni.
They didn't listen, they carried all of chicha into the house in small jugs and they
kept drinking until they couldn't stand up.
