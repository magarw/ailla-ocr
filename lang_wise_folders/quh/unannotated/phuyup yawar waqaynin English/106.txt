everyone was very happy. They got even happier when they saw everything that he
had brought. Faustino, Francisca and the children enjoyed the bananas and
oranges. When her husband gave her the money, Mama Francisca kissed
Faustion's hand with happiness.
Chay p'unchawmantaqa, may kusisqa papata jatun jallp'api tarpurikusqanku.
Qullqinkuqa mikhunankupaqpis karisqaña. Latanutapis jukta killapiqa mikhuqña

killamanta Kalallusta ayllunman kutipullaqtaq kasqa.
From that day, they were very happy, they planted potatoes in mounds in the
ground. Now there was money for food. They ate bananas once a month. When the
money had dwindled, Faustion headed back to Cochabamba. He earned money
working for a month, then went back home to Kalallusta for two months.
Juk p'unchaw qullqi pisiyaptin, -"Quchapampaman kutisaq"- ñisqa Faustinu.
One day when there wasn't much money, Faustino said "I'm going back to
Cochabamba".
-"Guillermitu jaku Quchapampaman, qampis qullqita ruwakamunki"- ñisqa kuraq
wawanta.
"Guillermo, let's go to Cochabamba, you'll also make money there," he said to his
oldest child.
-"¡Ama pusapuwaychu!, ¿imaynata pay qullqi ruwanqa? ¡uña waynuchullaraqqa!"- ñispa
mamanqa wawanmanta jark’akusqa.
"Don't take him from me! what money will he make? he still just a young boy!"
his mother said, blocking him from her child.
