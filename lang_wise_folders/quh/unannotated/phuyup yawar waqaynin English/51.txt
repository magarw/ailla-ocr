"It was good, yea" Maximiliano said.
-"Chayjinatapuni machaykusqaniri! Mana anchata yuyanichu imaynatachus kayman
chayamusqaytaqa. Ajajaja! Waltiku maypi qhipakapurqari?"- ñispataq Faustinu
tapurillasqataq.
"I was so incredibly drunk! I don't remember much about how we got here.
Hahaha! and where did Waltiku end up staying?" Faustino asked.
-"Chay karu qhipanchikta Wadalupiwan jamuchkarqankuqa”- Maximilianoqa ñisqa.
“We left him far behind, he was walking with Guadalupe" Maximiliano said.
-"Chaymantarí?"- ñispa Faustinu mancharikusqa.
"And then what happened?" Faustino said, starting to get scared.
-“Mana rikurqaniñachu, mana yuyaniñachu ah"- asirispa Maximiliano ñillasqataq.
"I haven't seen him since, I don't remember what happened" Maximiliano said,
laughing.
-"Chay karaju Waltiku Wadalupitachá ch'isi suwakapurqa, unaymantañapuni
suwakapusaq ñichkarqa"- ñispa Faustinuqa makinta uyanman churakuspa tumpata
t'ukurisqa.
“That bastard Waltiku probably got Guadalupe for the night, a while ago he said he
was going to go for it," Faustinu said, putting his hand on his face and thinking a
bit.
