"Little Mama Inkarna, that jerk Francisco is with his chola, little Mama Inkarna,
Francisco is with his other chola" he said.
Mama Inkarnaqa urituta uyariytawanqa sinchita t’ukurikusqa.
After hearing the parrot, Mama Inkarna thought hard:
-"¿Imaptinpunitaq kay uritu ajinata ñiwanri?, urituqa sumaq yachayniyuq, mana payqa
qhasita parlanmanchu. Chay qhincha Fransiskuqa chulanwanpunichá karikuchkan"-.
"Why does this parrot always say things like this to me? the parrot knows so much,
couldn't it just talk nonsense? That shameful Francisco is probably always with his
chola."
Ajinata t'ukurikuytawanqa, utqhayta yaku t'impunanpaq ninata inqhallasqapuni.
After thinking this, she quickly went back to lighting the fire to boil the water.
Yakuqa t'impuyta qallarisqa. Chaypitaq tata Fransiskuqa tumpa machasqa chayamusqa.
The water started to boil. And right then, Tata Francisco arrived a little drunk.
-"¿Maymantataq jamuchkankiri?, ¿Piwantaq kachkarqankiri?"- ñispa mama Inkarna
phiñarikusqa.
"Where are you coming from? and who were you with?" Mama Inkarna said
angrily.
