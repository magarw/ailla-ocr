order, they were: Guillermo, then Luwisa, and then Albino, and Fortunato was the
youngest. Everyday, their lives were very sad. Their fields didn't produce much
anymore. They suffered a lot over food. Faustino's relatives had gone to work in
the Chapare when tata Francisco and mama Inkarna died. Sometimes Apolonio
and his wife Gabina also lived in Kalallusta, but other times they didn't. His older
sister Libirata had gone to Cochabamba.
