Tumpata t'ukurispa tata Juvenal, Faustinuta qhawarispa ajinata ñisqa:
Thinking a little, tata Juvenal looked at Faustino and said:
-"¡Mikhurinaraq ah Faustinu! chanta khuskalla risunchik, ñuqapis Quchapampaman
risaq"- ñispa mikhuna wasi ukhuman pusaykusqa.
"Let's eat, Faustino! then we'll go together, I'll go to Cochabamba too,” he said,
taking him into the kitchen.
Chaypi sumaqta mikhusqanku, tukuy
mikhusqanku, tukuy imaymanamanta
imaymanamanta ch'aqwararisqanku.
Chaymantaqa Quchapampaman tata Juvenalpa awtunpi kachaykukusqanku.
They ate well there, and talked about everything. Then they headed off for
Cochabamba in Juvenal's car.
Tata Juvenal sumaq qullqirara runaqa, awtutapis rantikusqa. Chay awtupiqa
maymanpis, ima phanitapis rillaq kasqa. Chantapis sumaqta rikuq maypichus Libirata
tiyakusqantaqa. Chay p'unchaw Faustinuta pananpa wasinman chiqitunta apaspa.
Libiratap wasinqa Republicapi kasqa. Chanta pananpa wasin punkupi saqiytawan
utqhayllata ripuyta munasqa.
Tata Juvenal was a wealthy man, he had bought himself a car. In that car, he went
wherever, whenever. He went right to where Libirata lived. That day he took
Faustino straight to his sister's house. Libirata's house was in Republica. He tried
to leave quickly after leaving him at his sister's door.
-"Pachi Juvenal. Manachus qam, ¿imanaymantaq karqa? tinkunakama kachun”- ñispa
Faustinu Juvenalpa makinta q'apirisqa.
“Thanks Juvenal. If it weren't for you, what would have happened? see you later"
Faustino said, squeezing Juvenal's hand.
