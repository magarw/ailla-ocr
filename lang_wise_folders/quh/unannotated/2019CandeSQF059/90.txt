top of the trees. That was all that was left of Causiri. Seeing this, everyone from
Causiri's group disappeared to wherever. Even the Cow-Wrangler disappeared,
after leaving the coffin in the Julo²3 church for the corpse.

Manaraq ch'ampa awqanakuy kachkaptinqa, Rosendo Causiri juk aya tawa-k'uchuta
rantikusqa. Chantataq Waka Watanaman ajinata ñisqa:
Before the war, Rosendo Causiri had bought a coffin. Then he had said to the Cow-
Wrangler:
-"Sumaqtapuni kay tawa k'uchuta jallch'anki, ichapis ñuqata ch'ampa awqanakuypi
wañuchiwanqanku, kay tawa-k’uchupipuni p'ampawankichik”-.
"Be sure to keep this coffin, if they kill me in the war, bury me in it."
Manataq ajinachu kasqa, Causiritaqa juk llakiyta dinamita ñisqawan
chinkarparichisqanku. Causirip pistaninta juqhariykukuytawantaq: "¡ñuqanchik
atipananchik Karaju!"- ñispa tata Walter Guevarata yanapaqkunaqa kusirikusqanku.
But it wasn't to be like that, they made Causiri disappear altogether with one sad
stick of dynamite. And after taking Causiri's gun for themselves, tata Walter
Guevara's men said "we got you, jackass!", and they were happy.

Julo iñiy wasipi samarikusqanku. Iñiy wasiman yaykusqanku. Chaypitaq Causirip aya

They picked up Ricardo's sad body and while they were carrying it back to
Anzaldo they stopped in the Julo church to rest. They went in to the church. Inside,
Causiri's coffin was empty and abandoned.
