the coffin, tears started flowing from her eyes.
-"Faustinuy wañusqa chayri ¿imanasaqtaqri? ¡Tatituy ñiñitu!"- ñisqa. Ukhunpiqa
sunqun sinchimanta kharkatirikapusqa. Chantaqa, Faustinuta rikuytawanqa sunqun
t'ikayarisqataq. Chaymantaqa utqhayta ch'usaq lawata wayk'uq churakusqa.
"What will I do if my Faustino has died? my little man, my little child!" she said.
Inside, her heart trembled violently. Then she saw Faustino and her heart lept.
After that, she quickly went to prepare some empty soup.
Mankata yakuyuqta chhaqasqa, sara jak’uta lawaykusqa, ninapi t'impuchisqa, chantataq
lawata rupha ruphata qusanman jaywasqa pacha. Jina ruphata may yarqhasqa Faustinu
phukurispa phukurispa lawata may misk'ita qhutuykusqa.
She filled the pot with water, mixed in the dried corn, put it on the fire to boil and
then served the soup to her husband when it was nice and hot. Faustino was so
hungry he gobbled up the boiling hot soup, slurping down every delicious bite.
Albinowan Guillermitowanqa tatankup iskay phusilninta rikuytawankamaqa tukuy
imata tatankutaqa tapurisqanku. Tatankutaq mama Fransiskaman wawakunaman ima
tukuyta willarisqa. Tata Faustinuta uyariytawanqa llakirikusqankutaq
kusirikusqankutaq.
Albino and little Guillermo saw their father's two guns and asked him about
everything that had happened. And their father told mama Francisca and his
children everything. As they listened to tata Faustino, they were both sad and
happy.
Wakin runakunaqa Anzaldoman chayaytawan, wasinkuman ripurasqanku, wakintaq
