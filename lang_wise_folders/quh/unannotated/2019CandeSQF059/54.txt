Because it was the day of Carnival in Muruq'u Urqu, groups of young men came
into Maximiliano's house one after the other, singing. Every Carnival groups came
into the houses to sing and dance. When they sang, the owner of the house had to
offer them chicha, and the revelers had to give the owners delicious aphaylla.

Faustino, Maximiliano and three friends drank lots and lots of chicha, and when
they were a little drunk they started to sing and dance. Faustino wanted to dance
with Francisca, so he grabbed her hand and tried to pull her over. But Francisa
didn't want to, and she escaped into the kitchen, really frightened. She stayed in
the kitchen and didn't come out until it was evening. Then her older brother
Maximiliano saw her and led Francisca over to Faustino.
