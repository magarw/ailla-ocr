paqarintaq llakisqa:
Everyday, Faustino and some other men he didn't know worked carrying all sorts
of things on their backs. On Sundays, they went to Rio Rocha to wash their clothes.
One Sunday, they were coming back from the river and they went into a chichería.
There, they got Faustino drunk again, he didn't want to. He drank chicha that night
until dawn. Faustino blew all the money he had made on chicha that night. The
next morning he was sad:
-“¿Kunan ima qullqitataq Kalallustaman apasaqri? ¿Imaynallatataq mana qullqiyuq
chayasaqri?"- ñispa ukhunpi t'ukurispa llakirikusqa.
"Now what money will I take to Kalallusta? And how can I arrive with no
money?" he said to himself, worried.
Chay killa tukukuytaqa mana Kalallustaman kutisqachu. Mama Fransiska llakisqalla
qhipakusqa.
He didn't go back to Kalallusta at the end of that month. Mama Francisca was left
to worry.
-"¿Aqha uqunamanchu quykakapullantaq? ¿Imaptintaq qusay mana qullqiwan
kutirimunchu?"- ñispa t'ukuspalla puriykachaq kasqa.
"Is he giving himself again to gulping chicha? Why doesn't my husband come
back with some money?" she thought, pacing back and forth.
Faustinu chay p'unchawmanta-pacha, llamk'aqtaq aqha wasiman chiqitunta ripuqtaq
kasqa. Manañapuni Kalallusta ayllunmanqa kutisqachu. Sapa p'unchaw aqha wasillapiña
sayaq kasqa. Tutamanta llamk'aq kasqa, mikhuykuytawanqa sapa p'unchaw aqha
wasiman ripuq kasqa. Chaypi achkha runawan warmikunawan ima upyaq kasqanku.
