As soon as they were finished eating, Faustino, Waltiku and some other young men
and women left the house in a group, singing and dancing. Each one was all
dressed up, with beautiful streamers wrapped around their necks, and they tied
small balloons to these streamers to make them more beautiful. The women each
had a little bag, which they carried full of aphaylla.
