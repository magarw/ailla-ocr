Guillermo was just seventeen years old. He didn't know how to do much work yet,
he only knew how to take sheep and cows to graze. He already knew how to play
the accordian really well, he made his mom really happy everytime he played. That
day, his father took the young man to the city anyway.

When he had brought Guillermo to town, a friend of his sister Libirata's, Mario,
was there. He had a big belly. Green eyes.
-"Kay wawayki ñuqata wakata awtuman wasarichiyta yanapawanman. Pay
uywakunawan yachasqa, ¿ichari?"- ñispa Marioqa Faustinutawan Libiratatawan
tapusqa.
"Your child could help me get the cows onto the truck. He knows how to take care
of animals, right?" Mario asked Faustino and Libirata.
-“Arí, Guillermitoqa sumaqta wakata michin, kusatachá qamwan llamk’anman”- ñispa
tatanqa kutichisqa.
"Yes, Guillermo herds cows well, he should do a good job working with you," his
father replied.
