As soon as they learned of this, tata Walter Guevara's men, tata Jorge Solís, tata
José Rojas, tata Juvenal Castro and tata Miguel Veizaga, asked for help from
everyone from the towns in this area. Tata Miguel Veizaga was well respected in
Cliza, so he was the one who went to ask for help. And tata José Rojas was well
respected in Ukureña, and the surrounding area. Tata Juvenal Castro was the
mayor of Anzaldo, and so everyone also knew him. Like this, tata Walter Guevara
Arce's men prepared themselves to fight with Estenssoro's men in Viña. They
went around to every single community and asked for help from all the residents.
