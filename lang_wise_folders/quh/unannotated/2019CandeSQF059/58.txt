"And how am I going to go back to my father's house with my love?" he thought.
-"Kuraq turay warminta wasiman, kimsa wataña pusamurqa chaypi, tatayqa
iskayninkuta wikch'urqa. Chayraykutaq kuraq turay Chapare llaqtaman ripuytawan
juktawan mana kutirimunchu. Jinatachu ruwawanqa? Amachu wasiyman
chayapusaq?"- t'ukullasqapuni.
"My older brother brought his woman home three years ago, my father threw the
two of them out. And because of that, my brother went off to the Chapare and
never came back again. Will he do the same to me? Should I not go home?" he
kept thinking.
Jinallapi Kalallustaman chayaytawankamaqa ichhu wasiman pusaykunakusqanku,
unayta chukuykuytawan parlasqanku. Faustinuqa kusikuywantaq tumpa machasqataq
Fransiskata uqllaykusqa. Pulliranta q'ulluriytawankama ichhu patapi sunt'ichisqa
pacha.
As soon as they arrived in Kalallusta they went together to the grass house and sat
down and talked for a long time. Faustino hugged Francisca, happy and a little
drunk. He lifted up her skirt and then quickly laid her down on the long grass.
-"Amaraq Faustinu! amaraq!"- ñispa qhaparichisqa.
"Not yet, Faustino! not yet!" she cried out.
Jukninqa manapuni kacharisqachu, ajinamanta unayta chay ch’isi iskayninku ichhu
patapi sunt'ichinakusqanku. Chantataq q'ayantinkama ichhu ukhupi puñurparisqanku.
The boy still didn't let go, the two of them stayed like that for a long time that
night, making love on the hay.
Q'ayantin paqarinqa, mama Inkarna ichhuta wakaman qarananpaq jurqhuq jamusqa.
