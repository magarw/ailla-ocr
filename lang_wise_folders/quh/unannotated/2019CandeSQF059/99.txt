Nine days later, tata Faustino and mama Francisca went alone to Anzaldo to give a
mass for Albino. Some of their neighbors found out and came too. When the mass
was over, everyone went home. Mama Francisca and her husband arrived home
hungry. There wasn't even rotten corn in their house. The children begged, with
