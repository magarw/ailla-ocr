potatoes she had brought, and then sat down there in the corner and went right to
sleep.
Q'ayantinqa chhaqpu, chhaqputa, rikch'ariptin lliklla q'ipinta suwarparisqanku.
Sapallanna chay k'uchupi chukukuchkasqa. Sayariytawan mana maymanchus purinanta
yachasqachu.
When she got up the next day at the crack of dawn, they had stolen her bundle. She
was sitting in the corner all alone. She got up and didn't know where to go.
Chay p'unchawqa Quchapampa llaqtapi sapan puriykachasqa. Qusanmanta
tapurakuspa mask'asqa, manataq tarisqataqchu. Qhatumanpis chayasqa, chaypi

Fransiska ni juk waranqayuq. Yarqhaymantapis ch'akiymantapis wañuchkasqaña.
Llakisqalla qhatupi runata qhawaraspa purillasqapuni. Quchapampaman
jamusqanmanta allin qhispichisqa puriykachasqa.
She walked around Cochabamba alone that day. She looked around, asking about
her husband, but didn't find him. She got to the market, some women were selling
food and others were eating. Mama Francisca didn't have a cent. She was about to
die of hunger and thirst. She just kept walking, sadly looking at the people in the
market. As she was walking, she was very sorry she had come to Cochabamba.
Tapukuspallapuni purisqa manataq ni pitapis riqsisqata tarisqachu. Intipis

Tumpa tumpata yuyasqa maynintachus jamusqantaqa.
She walked and kept asking, but she didn't find anyone who knew. And then the
sun went down again, and she was right in Pulakayo, Barrientos. She just slightly
recognized where she had gotten to.
