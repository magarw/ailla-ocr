Mario was a cow seller. He bought cows from Tarata, Cliza, Arani, Punata,
Tiraque, Aiquile and some other places and brought them to Cochabamba to sell.
Mario made a lot of money selling cows. He bought cows cheap, and then sold
them at Cow Beach, as they called it, in Cochabamba for a lot more. Guillermo
worked for three whole months with Mario. He went everywhere with Mario,
looking for cows to buy.

One day they bought four bulls in Aiquile and were taking them to Cochabamba.
Guillermo was riding on top of the truck with the cows. The road from Aiquile to
Cochabamba was as scary as could be. Right before they got to a narrow curve, a
big truck appeared. That truck was zig-zagging along. The driver of this big truck
was pretty drunk. Tata Mario turned to the right, and the big truck did the same,
Mario turned back to the left, hard, and all at once they flipped right over.

"Ahh!" Guillermo cried out.
