Q'ayantin p'unchawqa tata Faustinu warminman ajinata ñisqa:
The next day tata Faustino said to his wife:
-"¿Wawakunata, imawantaq uywasun? ¿Yarqhaymantachu wañuchisun? ¡Mana! Kunan
pacha Quchapampa llaqtaman risaq chaypi kuraq panay Libirata tiyakun paypa
wasinman chayasaq. Qullqita llamk'aspa ruwasaq, chantataq juk killapi kutimusaq.
Qam chaykama uwijakunata michinki, sumaqta wawakunata qhawanki. Juk uwijata
ranqhaspa papata, sarata, riwuta ima rantimunki. Nuqataq qullqita llamk'aspa
ruwaytawankama kutimusaq. Papa mujutawan rantispa tarpukunanchikpaq apamusaq,
chantaqa kutillasaqtaq ajinata kunanmanta pacha kawsasunchik"-
"How will we take care of the children? Will we kill them with hunger? No! I'm
going to Cochabamba right now, my older sister Libira lives there, I'll go to her
house. I'll work for money, and then in a month I'll come back. Until then, you'll
take the sheep to graze, and take good care of the children. You'll sell one sheep
and then go buy potatoes, corn and wheat. And I'll come back when I've made
some money. I'll buy some potato seeds and bring them back for us to plant, and
then I'll go back again, and that's how we'll live from now on."
Chayta ñispaqa kuka wayaqanta juqhariykuytawan, kimsa p'achanta juk llikllapi
q'ipiriykukuytawan Quchapampaman chakipi kachaykukusqa. Chawpi p'unchawpaqqa
Clizaman chayasqa pacha. Tata Juvenal Castro Clizapi wasiyuq karqa. Faustinu chayta
yacharquytawanqa paypa wasinman chayarikusqa.
When he had said this, he took out his coca bag, wrapped up three changes of
clothes in a shawl and headed off for Cochabamba on foot. He got to Cliza at
midday. Tata Juvenal Castro had a house in Cliza. When Faustino though of this,
he went to his house.
