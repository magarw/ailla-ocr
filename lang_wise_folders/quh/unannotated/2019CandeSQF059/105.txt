From that day on, Libirata took her brother to the market, where there was money
to be made carrying things on his back. Then Faustino went by himself on foot to
the Cochabamba market everyday. Every day he made about 5 bolivianos. At the
end of the month, he had made about 130.

After making so much money, tata Faustino was really happy. One Thursday he
went to the market to shop. That day he bought: some potato seeds, carrots,
onions, tomatoes, potatoes, rice, bananas, oranges and some sweets for his
children.

The next day was Friday. A truck went from Cochabamba to Anzaldo every Friday,
there weren't trucks the other days. That day, Faustino loaded everything he had
bought into the truck and went back to Anzaldo.
