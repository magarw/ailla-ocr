"Let's hurry, let's not sing anymore, the water in the P'uqru Pata river will block
us," Waltiku said, calling out loudly.
-"Arí utqhayllata kutipunachik Kalallustanchikman"- ñispataq Faustinu yapasqa.
"Yes, let's hurry back home to our dear Kalallusta," Faustinu added.
Chayta uyariytawankama utqhayllata tukuy thatkimuchkaptinku para sinchimanta
jich’akuyta qallarisqa pacha. “Chhallallaq! Chhallallaq! Ch'araq! Ch'araq!” ñisqa paraqa
quchisqa. Wakinqa anchata machaykusqanku, ñanta jamuchkaspataq urman jatariyta
asikunapaqjina jamullasqankupuni. Wakinqa tukuy imaymanakunata ch'aqwaspajina
parapi jamullasqankutaq.
Then after hearing this, when everyone was rushing back, the rain started to pour
down harder. "Crash! boom!" the rain continued to stream down. Some of them
were very drunk, and were coming down the road falling down and getting back up
again comically. Others were just coming along in the rain, talking about
everything.
Waltikuwan Wadalupiwan parlaspa alliymanta jamuchkasqanku, jinallapi karu qhipapi
wakinkunamantaqa qhiparparikusqanku. Waltikuqa Wadalupita uqllaykusqa.
Wadalupiqa manchi manchilla paywan khuska thatkimuchkallasqapuni. Jinallapi
Waltiku Wadalupimanta mantanta qhichuspa llikllaykukusqa.
Waltiku and Guadalupe were walking slowly talking, and like this they got left far
behind the others. Waltiku hugged Guadalupe. Guadalupe kept walking with him,
a bit afraid. All of a sudden, Waltiku took Guadalupe's blanket and wrapped
himself in it.
-"Mantayta qupuway"- ñispa Wadalupiqa qhichukapuyta munasqa.
"Give me my blanket" Guadalupe said, trying to take it back.
