-"Guillermitu wañusqa jampina wasipi kachkan"- llakisqa ñisqa Marioqa.
"Little Guillermo is dead in the hospital," Mario said sadly.
-"Qam wañuchinki ¡karaju! ¿Imanapuwankitaq wawayta?"- ñispa Mariota maqayta
munasqa.
"You killed him, you jerk! What did you do to my child?" he said, trying to hit
Mario.
-"Ama jinaychu"- ñispa wakinqa jark'arakusqanku.
"It's not like that" the other said, protecting himself.
Chaymanta tukuyta Libiratawan Mariowanqa Faustinuman Guillermitumanta
willasqanku. Jinallapi Faustinupis phutiyta waqarikusqa, chantataq jampina wasiman
pananwan kachaykukusqanku. Mariotaq awtuntawan wakantawan watukuq risqa.
Then Libirita and Mario told Faustino all about Guillermo. Suddenly Faustino
burst into tears, then he set out for the hospital with his sister. Mario went to see
about his cows and truck.
Jampina wasipiqa mana ayata jurqhuchiyta munasqankuchu. Aya tawa-k'uchuta
apanankuta ñisqanku. Ajinata jurqhuyta atinkuman kasqa. Jinapi aya tawa-k’uchutapis
Libirata rantisqa, Faustinu aqha uqusqanpi ni juk phatayuq kasqa.
At the hospital, they didn't want to take the body out. They had to bring a coffin,
they said. That's how they should take it out. So Libirata bought a coffin, Faustino
didn't have a single dime because he had spent his money drinking chicha.
Marioqa ayata Anzaldo chiruman, Kalallusta llaqtanman apapuyta munasqapis.
