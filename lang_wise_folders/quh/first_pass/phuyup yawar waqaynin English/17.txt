The next morning when it was still dark, Tata Francisco arrived at the house drunk,
just as the rooster crowed for the first time.
-"¡Inkarna! ¿Maytaq mikhuna?"- ñispa, punkuta sinchita jayt'aspa kichariytawan
yaykumusqa.
"Inkarna! where is the food?" he said. He came in, throwing the door open.
-“¿Imaptintaq wawata sapanta kachampurqankiri?” -ñispa mama Inkarnaqa payman
phiñasqa chimpasqa.
"Why did you just send the boy back alone?" Mama Inkarna said to him, going
over to him angrily.
-"¡Manachu chakiyuq imataqri! Chakiyuqqa, kay chayampusqaqa. ¡utqhayta mikhunata
jaywaway!" -ñispa Fransiskuqa astawan phiñarikusqa.
"Doesn't he have feet?! He has feet, he can get here. Bring me some food,
quickly!" Fransisco said, very angry.
-"Jinallatapuni qamqa ñuqaykuta ñak'arichiwayku ¡saqra! ¡lisu!" -ñispa mama
Inkarnaqa phiñasqa wayk'una wasimanta ila k'ispiñuta jurqhumuytawan jaywasqa.
“You always make us suffer like that! bastard! jerk!” Mama Inkarna said angrily
from the kitchen. She took out some cold wheat patties and served them to him.
