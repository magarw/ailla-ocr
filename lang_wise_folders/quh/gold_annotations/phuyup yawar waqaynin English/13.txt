When the rain calmed a little, it began to get cold. Faustino's clothes were
completely soaked, dripping water. He began to tremble from the cold and his wet
clothes, and the darkness scared him. Unable to do anything, the child sat down on
the bank of the river and cried sadly. It was too far to turn back to his father, and
the river was too full of water to cross. Unable to do anything, there in the dark he
kept crying sadly, not even the moon shone down on him as it got darker. Looking
out in front of him, he saw a big black cliff; looking down, he saw the trees with
their limbs flailing, as if they were people sparring back and forth. He was even
more afraid – “hiccup, hiccup” – he said, at the silent river bank he cried and cried,
becoming very distressed.
Faustinup wasinpiqa mama Inkarnaqa ch'isi mikhunata chayachiytawankamaqa,
llakisqa phichqa wawanwan ima t’ukurisqa.
At Faustino's house, right after she prepared the evening meal, Mama Inkarna was
thinking about her poor fifth child.
-"Yakuchá tataykichiktawan Faustinuytawan jark'aykun. Ichapis taripamuq risunman”-
ñisqa.
"Maybe the water stopped your father and Faustino. Perhaps we should go find
them." She said.
-“Arí mamay jaku rinachik kay ch'aki punchukunatawan apanachik q’alitutachá para
juq'uykun”- kuraq warmi-wawan Libirata sutiyuq kutichisqa.
