Tata Francisco started to eat the cold wheat patties with hot sauce. Just then,
Faustino got up.
-"Sumaq p'unchaw tatay, sumaq p'unchaw mamay”-
"Good morning Papa, good morning Mama"
Tatan mamanta napaykuytawan Faustinuqa, yakuq'uñita mut'iyuqta mikhusqa.
Quqawita uña llikllanpi q'ipiriykukuytawantaq yachay-wasiman Rodeo³ aylluman

After greeting his mother and father, Faustino ate his breakfast of boiled corn. The
boy wrapped up a little lunch in his shawl and headed out to his school, in the town
of Rodeo³.
-"¡Richkaniña!" -ñispa punku-wasamanta qhaparimusqa.
"I'm off!" he said calling from by the door.
-"Allin pacha waway utqhayllata rirquy, sumaqtamin yachachiq ñisqanta ruwanki
¿yachu?” -mamanqa ñisqa. Tatanqa machasqa ni uyarillasqapischu, mikhullasqapuni.
"Go on my boy, do what your teacher says, ok?" His mother said. His drunk father
didn't even hear, he just kept on eating.
-"Ya mamay” - ñispa punkuta kichariytawan lluqsisqa.
“Yes mama!” he said, he opened the door and left.
