"Yes Mama, let's go. Let's take dry ponchos, the rain may have completely soaked
them." Libirata, the eldest daughter, responded.
Mama Inkarnawan, Libiratawan, Apoloniowan, Juliawan imaqa chakipi
kachaykukusqanku. Chay ch'isiqa michiru juqharisqa, ñanta k'ancharispa thatkisqanku.
P'uqru Pata mayuman chayachkaptinkuña Faustinuqa michiru k'anchata

Mama Inkarna, Libirata, Apolonio and Julia headed off on foot. They took out the
lantern that night, they walked along a well-lit road. When they were getting to the
P'uqru Pata river, Faustino saw the lantern glow and immediately called out in
distress.
-“¡Ayllu-masikuna, yaku jark'aykuwan!"- sunqu nanayta, sinchita qhaparikamusqa.
"Neighbors! the water has blocked me!" he cried out loudly, his heart aching.
-"¡Chay Faustinituysinaqa!" - ñispa mama Inkarnaqa utqhayta purirpasqa.
"That sounds like my little Faustino!" Mama Inkarna said, walking faster.
-“¿Imaptintaq sapitan kachkanmanri?"- ñispa Juliataq mamanpaq qhipanta utqhayta
purillasqataq.
"Why would he be alone?” said Julia, and continued walking quickly after her
mother.
Mayuman chayaptinku, wawaqa sapitan mayu kantupi llamt'itantin llakiyta
chukukuchkasqa.
When they got to the river, the child was alone at the bank of the river, sitting sadly
with all of his wood.
