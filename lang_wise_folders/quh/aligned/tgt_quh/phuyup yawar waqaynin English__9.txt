Tata Francisco and little Faustino were walking quickly back home after having
gone to weed potatoes on Chullpa Muqu' all day long. When they were on the road
heading back, lots of the townspeople were drinking chicha at Kumpa Philip's
place. Just as Kumpa Philip came out of his house, he looked out and saw Tata
Francisco coming down the road together with his child.
-"¡Jamuy Fransisku!" - ñispa sinchimanta qhaparimusqa.
"Come on in, Francisco!" he said, calling out loudly.

In the little community of Kalallusta, Tata Francisco was a well respected person.
He had a lot of money. He also had a lot of land, and grew everything very well.
"He talks to the devil", all the townspeople said. He was a very mean man.
