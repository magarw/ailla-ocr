Translator's note
This translation was prepared by Gillian Gallagher with the assistance of Gladys Camacho Rios,
the author and a native speaker of Quechua from Cochabamba, Bolivia. The translation is meant
to be helpful to students of Quechua. To this end, the English translation has been interspersed
with the original Quechua, paragraph-by-paragraph. Additionally, every effort was made to
remain as close as possible to the original Quechua in the structure of the translation. In many
cases, this meant sacrificing some naturalness and flow in the English. In other cases, substantial
modification from Quechua to English were unavoidable. Errors, questions or suggestions are
welcome and should be directed to Gillian Gallagher at ggillian@nyu.edu. The novela was
completed in May 2013 and published in Bolivia by Kipus. The translation was completed in
September 2014, and was partially supported by funds from the Center of Latin American and
Carribean Studies at New York University.
