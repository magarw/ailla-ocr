karutaraq thatkimuna kasqa, P'uqru Pata mayutapis chimpamunaraq kasqa.
The child silently left the house and went on towards home, carrying the wood.
There was a still a long way to go from Tata Phillip's house to get to Faustino's
house, and he still had to cross the P'uqru Pata² river.
Sapitan Faustinuqa jampuchkasqa, karutañamin thatkimusqa, jinallapi jukta paraqa
sut'uykachariyta qallarisqa pacha. Wawaqa patata qhawarisqa, yana phuyukuna junt’ita
urmaykurimuchkankumanpis jina tukuy chiruman kuyuykacharisqanku.
Faustino was heading back alone, and when he had already walked very far, all of
a sudden, rain started to drip down. The child looked up, the full black clouds
moved back and forth, looking as though they were were about to fall down.
-"¡Lliphiq! ¡Lliphiq! ¡Qhururun! ¡Qhururun!" - patapiqa sinchita uyaririkusqa.
He suddenly heard the crash! boom! of thunder from the sky, and saw the flash of
lightning.
Astawan paraqa sinchimanta jich'akuyta qallarisqa. Faustinutaq mancharisqa utqhayta
thatkillasqapuni. Ichapis payqa yachasqaña P'uqru Pata mayuman sapa paraptin achkha
yaku chayamunantaqa. Wasinman chayapunanpaqtaq chay mayutaqa chimpananpuni
kasqa. Mana chay mayupi chaka tiyaqchu.
The rain started to pour down even harder. Faustino kept walking quickly, afraid.
He may have known that every time it rained, a lot of water filled the P'uqru Pata
river. And to get home, he had to cross that river. There was no bridge over the
river.
