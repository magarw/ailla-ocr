-"¡Mamay! tatay kumpa Philipippi qhipakun, ñuqatataq wasiman ripuchkay ñispa
sapitayta kacharpampuwan"- ñispa Faustinuqa sinchimanta jik’un jik’un waqaririspa
mamanman willarikamusqa.
"Mama! Papa stayed at Kumpa Phillip's, and sent me off by myself to go home"
Faustino told his mother, choking loudly on his tears.
-"Ama waqaychu wawitay, kunititan chimpamusqayku” -ñispa mamanqa llakisqa
kutichisqa.
"Don't cry my child, we will cross right now," his mother answered sadly.
Maman paymanta

manchachikusqañachu. Tawa phanimantawanqa pisimanta pisi yaku pisiyasqa.
Astawan yaku pisiyaptinqa, mamanqa Juliawan, Libiratawan, Apoloniowan ima mat’ita

Once he knew his mother was close by, Faustino wasn't afraid anymore. Over four
hours, the water level went down little by little. When the water had gone down
enough, his mother, Julia, Libirata and Apolonio grabbed onto each other tightly
and began to cross the river. The water was up to their ankles, all the water almost
made them fall. Carrying the ponchos, Julia tightened her grip on her mother and
brother, and like that they all crossed the river.
-"¡Kay millana qhincha, wawaytachu sapanta kachampuwan! ¿Maypi kunan tatayki
kachkanri?”- mama Inkarnaqa ñisqa.
"Oh that awful, wretched man, sending my child back to me alone. Where is your
father now?" Mama Inkarna said.
