Tata Phillip was a skinny little guy, with a chichería on the main road in the town
of Kalallusta. Since his wife died, he had been making chicha on his own and
selling it to everyone in town. That day, Tata Phillip went up to Tata Francisco,
grabbed him by the hand and pulled him into his house. Faustino, not wanting to
leave his father, also went in after him, carrying his load of wood.
-"¡Tatay ama aqhata upyankichu! ¡tutayawasunman ripunallaña tatay!" ñispa,
Faustinuqa tatanman parlasqa.
"Papa, don't drink chicha! Let's go before it gets dark on us, Papa." Faustino said
to his father.
-"¡Karaju! ¡Mana kaypi wawakuna aqhata upyankuchu! Qamqa jutqhayta wasiman
ripuy! ¡chay llamt'ata mamayki wayk'unanpaq, utqhayta apay!" - ñispa tata Fransiskuqa
wawanta ch'inyarparichisqa.
"Damnit! Children don't drink chicha here! You, go home right away! That wood
is for your mother to cook with, take it to her quickly!" said Tata Francisco,
silencing his child instantly.
-"Arí Faustinitu, ripullayña, ¿yachu? Nuqaykuqa tataykiwan juk juch'uy p'uyñu
aqhitataraq upyarqusqayku, chanta tataykiqa jampullanqa”- kumpa Philipiqa ñisqa.
"Yes, Faustino, go on, ok? We'll just drink a small jug of chicha, your father and
me, and then he'll head back." Kumpa Phillip said.
